# How to Get Your Railway Deployment URL

## Option 1: From Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/d3a0b8ca-a68d-445b-a5eb-6b6db890c1af
2. Click on your **control-plane** service (or whichever service is running JARVIS)
3. Go to the **"Settings"** tab
4. Scroll down to **"Networking"** → **"Public Networking"**
5. You'll see a section called **"Domains"**
6. Copy the domain that looks like:
   ```
   https://yourapp.up.railway.app
   ```

## Option 2: Generate a Domain (If None Exists)

If you don't see a domain:

1. In the **"Settings"** tab → **"Networking"** section
2. Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. Railway will create a public URL like: `https://control-plane-production-abc123.up.railway.app`
4. Copy that URL

## Option 3: Use Railway CLI

```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/JARVIS_AI/control-plane
railway link
# Select your project and service
railway domain
```

## What to Do Once You Have the URL

Once you have your Railway URL (e.g., `https://jarvis-control-plane.up.railway.app`), run:

```bash
# Test if it's working
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/health

# If that works, tell me the URL and I'll update the ChatGPT configuration!
```

## Common Railway URLs

Your URL will look like one of these:
- `https://jarvis-control-plane.up.railway.app`
- `https://control-plane-production-abc123.up.railway.app`
- `https://jarvis-ai-d3a0b8ca.up.railway.app`

**Just paste your Railway URL here once you find it!**
