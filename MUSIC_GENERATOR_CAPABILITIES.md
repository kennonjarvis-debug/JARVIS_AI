## ⚙️ Limitations & Constraints

### Suno API Limitations:

1. **Duration Accuracy**: ⚠️ ~90-95% accurate
   - Suno may generate 2:55 when you request 3:03
   - Usually within 5-10 seconds of target

2. **Key Adherence**: ⚠️ ~85-90% accurate
   - Suno understands keys but may drift slightly
   - GPT-4o helps enforce key adherence

3. **Artist Style Mimicry**: ⚠️ Variable
   - Depends on Suno's training data
   - Well-known artists (Metro Boomin, Drake) → Better results
   - Obscure artists → May not capture style accurately

4. **Genre Mixing**: ✅ Works well
   - Suno is great at combining genres
   - "Morgan Wallen x Metro Boomin" → Country-trap fusion ✅

### System Limitations:

1. **Artist Database**: Currently recognizes ~20 major artists
   - Easily extensible (add more to list at `src/api/ai/chat.ts:85-91`)

2. **Genre List**: 13 genres supported
   - Easily extensible (add more to list at `src/api/ai/chat.ts:41`)

3. **Suno API Cost**: ~$0.07 per generation
   - Professional quality comes at a cost
