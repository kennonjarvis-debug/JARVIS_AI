## ✨ Production Features

### Security
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error sanitization
- ⚠️ Rate limiting (configurable, disabled by default)
- ⚠️ HTTPS (manual setup required)
- ⚠️ Authentication (not implemented - internal use)

### Scalability
- ✅ Stateless API design (except conversations)
- ✅ Caching reduces database load
- ✅ SSE for efficient real-time updates
- ⚠️ Horizontal scaling ready (needs Redis for sessions)
- ⚠️ Load balancing ready (needs configuration)

### Observability
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Cache statistics
- ✅ Console logging
- ⚠️ Structured logging (not configured)
- ⚠️ Error tracking (Sentry not configured)
- ⚠️ Performance monitoring (not configured)

### Data Management
- ✅ In-memory conversation storage
- ✅ File-based monitoring data
- ⚠️ No persistence for conversations
- ⚠️ No backup strategy (manual required)
- ⚠️ No data retention policy

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

### 1. Conversation Storage
- **Issue**: Conversations stored in-memory (lost on restart)
- **Impact**: Medium (internal use, can recreate)
- **Recommendation**: Implement Redis/MongoDB for persistence

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Issue**: Not enabled by default
- **Impact**: Low (internal use, trusted users)
- **Recommendation**: Enable in production if exposed externally

### 3. Authentication
- **Issue**: No user authentication
- **Impact**: Low (internal tool)
- **Recommendation**: Add if deploying publicly

### 4. Error Tracking
- **Issue**: No centralized error tracking
- **Impact**: Medium (harder to debug production issues)
- **Recommendation**: Integrate Sentry or similar

### 5. Logging
- **Issue**: Basic console logging only
- **Impact**: Medium (no log persistence/search)
- **Recommendation**: Implement Winston with file/cloud storage
