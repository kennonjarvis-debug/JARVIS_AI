## üé¨ DEMO SCRIPT (5 MINUTES)

### Opening (30 sec)
**Say**: "This is JARVIS - my AI-powered autonomous control plane managing the entire AI DAWG music production platform. Everything you're about to see is running live right now."

### Act 1: Show It's Running (1 min)
1. Show terminal: `ps aux | grep jarvis`
2. Curl health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`
3. Say: "JARVIS is running on port 4000, monitoring everything 24/7"

### Act 2: Autonomous Agents (1.5 min)
1. Show log: `tail -f /tmp/jarvis.log | grep "Autonomous"`
2. Point out:
   - "5 domain agents registered"
   - "Music Production, Marketing, Cost Optimization, System Health"
3. Show opportunities detected:
   - "Code optimization found 1 issue"
   - "Cost optimization found 2 savings"
   - "Marketing detected 1 campaign opportunity"
4. Say: "The AI is constantly analyzing and finding ways to improve"

### Act 3: Auto-Recovery (1.5 min)
1. Show log: `tail -f /tmp/jarvis.log | grep BusinessOperator`
2. Point out auto-restart sequence:
   - "Service unhealthy detected"
   - "Auto-restarting attempt 2/3"
   - "Successfully restarted"
3. Say: "When services fail, JARVIS automatically restarts them. No human intervention needed."

### Act 4: Alert System (30 sec)
1. Show macOS notification center
2. Show alerts received
3. Say: "Every issue gets pushed to my iPhone and Mac instantly"

### Closing (30 sec)
**Say**: "This is the future of DevOps - fully autonomous AI managing infrastructure, detecting issues, and fixing them automatically. JARVIS runs 24/7 so I don't have to."

## üêõ Known Issues (Not Critical for Demo)

1. **AI DAWG TypeScript Error**:
   - File: `ai-dawg-v0.1/src/modules/music/music-production-domain.ts:355`
   - Error: 'catch' or 'finally' expected
   - **Impact**: Doesn't affect JARVIS autonomous operations

2. **Producer Container Missing**:
   - Docker container `ai-dawg-producer` doesn't exist
   - Auto-recovery correctly reports "No such container"
   - **Impact**: Shows alert system working (critical alerts sent)

3. **macOS Alert JSON Errors**:
   - Some notification payloads have formatting issues
   - **Impact**: Notifications still send successfully
