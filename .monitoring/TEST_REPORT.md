## 🐛 ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 🔴 CRITICAL (0)
None

### 🟡 WARNINGS (3)

1. **Control Plane Authentication**
   - **Severity:** LOW (by design)
   - **Description:** Dashboard chat falls back to demo mode due to 401 auth requirement
   - **Impact:** Chat works but uses mock responses instead of real AI
   - **Recommendation:** Configure auth token in Dashboard API or make /execute endpoint publicly accessible for internal services
   - **File:** `src/core/gateway.ts` (auth middleware)

2. **Module Health Reporting**
   - **Severity:** LOW
   - **Description:** AI DAWG vitality shows 0% module health
   - **Impact:** Dashboard may show "unknown" health for some modules
   - **Recommendation:** Implement module-level health checks
   - **File:** `src/backend/health/vitality.ts`

3. **SSE Streaming Test Coverage**
   - **Severity:** LOW
   - **Description:** Automated SSE streaming test limited (no `timeout` on macOS)
   - **Impact:** Manual verification needed for real-time updates
   - **Recommendation:** Use Node.js test script for SSE validation
   - **File:** N/A (testing infrastructure)

### 🟢 ENHANCEMENTS (2)

1. **Real AI Integration**
   - Add authentication mechanism for Dashboard → Control Plane communication
   - Enable actual AI brain responses instead of demo mode fallback

2. **Conversation Persistence**
   - Currently in-memory only (clears on restart)
   - Consider adding database or file-based storage
