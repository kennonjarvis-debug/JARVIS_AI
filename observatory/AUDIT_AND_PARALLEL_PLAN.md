## Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Audio Latency** (DAWG)
   - Risk: Browser <10ms latency difficult
   - Mitigation: AudioWorklet + WASM, extensive testing
   - Owner: Instance 3

2. **Multi-Agent Complexity** (JARVIS)
   - Risk: LangGraph state management complex
   - Mitigation: Start simple, incremental complexity
   - Owner: Instance 5

3. **Voice Recognition** (DAWG)
   - Risk: Music terminology confusion
   - Mitigation: Deepgram Nova-3, domain vocabulary
   - Owner: Instance 4

4. **Integration** (Both)
   - Risk: 6 instances, many dependencies
   - Mitigation: Strong API contracts, dedicated testing instance
   - Owner: Instance 6

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Performance** (DAWG)
   - Risk: Browser resource constraints
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading, code splitting, Web Workers

2. **State Management** (DAWG)
   - Risk: Complex state with Zustand
   - Mitigation: Clear separation of concerns

3. **Agent Coordination** (JARVIS)
   - Risk: Agents stepping on each other
   - Mitigation: LangGraph handles routing

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Automated Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script
~/SETUP_PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT.sh
```

This will:
1. Create all git branches
2. Set up git worktrees
3. Copy documentation to each worktree
4. Create development status file
5. Verify service status

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Review Documentation**
   ```bash
   cat ~/Jarvis-v0/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md
   cat ~/Jarvis-v0/QUICK_START_PARALLEL.md
   ```

2. **Create Branches**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Jarvis-v0
   git branch langgraph-feature
   git branch integration-feature

   cd ~/Development/DAWG_AI
   git branch frontend-feature
   git branch audio-engine-feature
   git branch midi-voice-feature
   ```

3. **Create Worktrees**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Jarvis-v0
   git worktree add ../jarvis-langgraph langgraph-feature
   git worktree add ../jarvis-integration integration-feature

   cd ~/Development/DAWG_AI
   git worktree add ../dawg-frontend frontend-feature
   git worktree add ../dawg-audio-engine audio-engine-feature
   git worktree add ../dawg-midi-voice midi-voice-feature
   ```

4. **Launch Instances**
   ```bash
   # Instance 2 (CRITICAL)
   cd ~/Development/dawg-frontend && claude code

   # Instance 3 (CRITICAL)
   cd ~/Development/dawg-audio-engine && claude code

   # Instance 4 (HIGH)
   cd ~/Development/dawg-midi-voice && claude code

   # Instance 5 (HIGH)
   cd ~/jarvis-langgraph && claude code
   ```

## Files Created

1. **PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md** - Comprehensive master plan with all prompts
2. **QUICK_START_PARALLEL.md** - Quick start guide for launching instances
3. **SETUP_PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT.sh** - Automated setup script
4. **AUDIT_AND_PARALLEL_PLAN.md** - This file (audit summary)

---

## Conclusion

Both JARVIS and DAWG AI have strong foundations but critical gaps that prevent full functionality:

- **JARVIS**: Needs LangGraph orchestration for intelligent multi-agent coordination
- **DAWG AI**: Needs complete frontend, audio engine, and MIDI editor

By deploying 6 Claude Code instances in parallel with clear prompts and coordination, both systems can be completed in **8 weeks** and delivered production-ready.

**Next Step**: Run `~/SETUP_PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT.sh` to begin.
