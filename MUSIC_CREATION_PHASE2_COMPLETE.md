    }
  }
}
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Already installed in Phase 1:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Music Generation

#### Option A: Use Local Mode (No API Keys Required)

This generates composition **blueprints** (no actual audio yet):

```env
# In .env
MUSIC_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=local
```

Local mode creates JSON files with:
- Song structure
- Instrument arrangements
- Production notes
- Step-by-step composition guide

**Use local mode for:**
- Testing the workflow
- Generating composition ideas
- Manual production in your DAW
- Development without API costs

#### Option B: Use Suno AI (Best Quality, With Vocals)

Get API key from https://suno.ai/api

```env
MUSIC_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=suno
SUNO_API_KEY=your-suno-api-key
```

**Features:**
- Full song generation with AI vocals
- Highest quality output
- ~$30/month for unlimited generations
- 2-5 minute generation time

#### Option C: Use MusicGen (Open Source, Instrumentals Only)

Get Replicate API key from https://replicate.com

```env
MUSIC_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=musicgen
MUSIC_GEN_API_KEY=your-replicate-api-key
```

**Features:**
- Fast instrumental generation
- Open-source Meta model
- Pay per generation (~$0.02/track)
- 30-second generations

#### Option D: Use Stable Audio

Get API key from https://stability.ai

```env
MUSIC_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=stable-audio
STABLE_AUDIO_API_KEY=your-stability-api-key
```

### 3. Create Output Directories

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/jarvis-generated-music
mkdir -p /tmp/jarvis-audio-mixing
mkdir -p /tmp/jarvis-compositions
```

---

## Testing

### Test Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start server
npm run dev:gateway

# 2. Upload voice memo
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/music/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" \
  -F "file=@voice-memo.m4a" \
  -F "userId=testuser" \
  -F "autoCompose=true"

# Response includes uploadId
{
  "uploadId": "upload-123",
  "status": "processing"
}

# 3. Wait ~60-90 seconds for processing
# Phase 1: Vocal isolation + transcription + analysis (30-45s)
# Phase 2: Lyric generation + music generation + mixing (30-45s)

# 4. Check final status
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/music/upload/upload-123/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token"

# 5. Download final song!
# Check the response for composition.finalMixPath
```

## Example: Complete Song Generation

### Input Voice Memo
*"Yo, this is a chill track about late night vibes, feeling nostalgic about the good times. Thinking about you when I'm alone. Slow tempo, emotional, maybe 80 BPM. Hip-hop with R&B vibes."*

### Phase 1 Output (Musical Intent)
```json
{
  "genre": "hip-hop",
  "subGenres": ["chill-hop", "r&b"],
  "mood": "melancholic",
  "tempo": 85,
  "energy": 4,
  "themes": ["nostalgia", "love", "late-night", "introspection"]
}
```

### Phase 2 Output (Lyrics)
```
[VERSE 1]
Thinking about you late at night
Stars above, your face in my mind so bright
Used to laugh until the sunrise came
Now I'm here alone, whispering your name

[CHORUS]
Late night vibes, got me feeling some type of way
Memories replay, wishing you would stay
Chill in the air, but my heart's on fire
These late night vibes got me caught in desire

[VERSE 2]
Scrolling through old photos on my phone
Every smile reminds me I'm here alone
Good times fade but never disappear
Your voice echoes when nobody's near

[CHORUS]
Late night vibes, got me feeling some type of way
Memories replay, wishing you would stay
Chill in the air, but my heart's on fire
These late night vibes got me caught in desire

[BRIDGE]
Maybe one day we'll find our way back
Until then I'm lost in this soundtrack
Of our memories playing on repeat
Late night vibes where our hearts still meet

[OUTRO]
Late night vibes... thinking about you
```

### Phase 2 Output (Music)
- **Instrumental**: 85 BPM hip-hop beat with lo-fi piano, soft 808s, vinyl crackle
- **Mixing**: Vocals forward, beat at 80%, reverb on vocals
- **Mastering**: Normalized to -14 LUFS, compressed, limited
- **Final Output**: Professional-quality MP3

**Total Time**: ~2 minutes
**Total Cost**: ~$0.07

## Advanced Features

### Custom Lyric Expansion

```typescript
// Expand partial lyrics to full song
const lyrics = await lyricGenerator.expandLyrics(
  "Yo, I'm feeling good today, sun is shining bright",
  musicalIntent
);
```

### Specific Hook Generation

```typescript
// Generate just a chorus
const hook = await lyricGenerator.generateHook(
  musicalIntent,
  'chorus'
);
```

### Mix Presets

```typescript
// Different mixing styles
await audioMixer.mixVocalsWithBeat(
  vocals,
  beat,
  output,
  {
    preset: 'vocal-forward', // or 'beat-forward', 'lo-fi', 'polished'
    mastering: true
  }
);
```

### Apply Vocal Effects

```typescript
await audioMixer.applyVocalEffects(
  vocalsPath,
  outputPath,
  [
    { type: 'compression' },
    { type: 'eq' },
    { type: 'reverb' },
    { type: 'autotune' } // Simple pitch correction
  ]
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No audio generated (local mode)"

**Expected behavior**. Local mode creates composition blueprints, not audio files.

**Solutions**:
1. Configure Suno/MusicGen API key
2. Use blueprint with your DAW
3. Test workflow without actual audio

### "Music generation timed out"

Suno AI can take 2-5 minutes for full song generation.

**Solutions**:
1. Increase timeout in code
2. Check API status
3. Fallback to local mode

### "Mixing failed: FFmpeg error"

**Solution**:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### "Lyrics don't match my style"

**Solution**: Add artist style reference:
```typescript
const lyrics = await lyricGenerator.generateLyrics(musicalIntent, {
  artistStyle: "Drake, Mac Miller, J. Cole",
  existingLyrics: yourLyrics
});
```
