# üöÄ JARVIS - Ready to Complete Setup!

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Current Status:** 3/8 integrations working
**Time to Full Operation:** ~1 hour

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ALREADY WORKING

JARVIS has already **successfully posted autonomously** to Twitter!

**Test Post:** https://twitter.com/JarvisAiCo/status/1978832324101120162

**Working Integrations:**
- ‚úÖ **Twitter** - Can post, read mentions, track engagement
- ‚úÖ **Claude AI** - Generating content with your brand voice
- ‚úÖ **Twilio** - Can send SMS notifications ($13.31 balance)

**What this means:** JARVIS can already do marketing automation right now! He just needs the remaining integrations for full autonomy.

---

## üéØ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (1 Hour Total)

I've created an **interactive setup wizard** that makes this super easy:

```bash
cd ~/Jarvis-v0
npx tsx setup-integrations.ts
```

**Choose option 5** (All of them!) and follow the prompts.

### The wizard will help you set up:

**1. Supabase (30 min)** - Database
- Creates free account
- Sets up project
- Configures credentials
- Creates all tables automatically
- **Enables:** Task history, analytics, learning

**2. Buffer (30 min)** - Social media scheduling
- Creates free account (3 channels)
- Walks through OAuth flow
- Gets access token automatically
- Fetches your profile IDs
- **Enables:** LinkedIn, Facebook posting + better Twitter scheduling

**3. HubSpot (15 min)** - CRM
- Creates free account
- Shows how to create Private App
- Gets token (must start with "pat-")
- **Enables:** Lead management, sales automation

**4. Discord (5 min)** - Notifications (optional but recommended)
- Creates webhook
- Sends test message
- **Enables:** Better approval notifications than SMS

**P.S.** After JARVIS is running, you can customize:
- Posting times: Edit `config/content/calendar.json`
- Content themes: Edit `config/content/strategy.json`
- Brand voice: Edit `config/knowledge/brand-voice.json`
- Approval rules: Edit `config/workflows/decision-rules.json`

**P.P.S** JARVIS has already proven he works - he successfully posted this:
> "Monday morning mix tip: Layer your kick drum with a subtle sub-bass sine wave at the same root note. Instant low-end glue that translates better on small speakers. üéß #MusicProduction #ProducerLife"

That's quality, on-brand content generated autonomously! Now let's get the rest set up so he can do this 3x/day across all platforms! üéØ
