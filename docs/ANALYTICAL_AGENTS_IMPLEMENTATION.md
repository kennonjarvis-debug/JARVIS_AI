## Files Modified

### 1. Domain Types Enum
**File:** `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/autonomous/types.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
export enum DomainType {
  // Existing domains...
  DATA_SCIENCE = 'data-science',  // NEW
  MARKETING = 'marketing',         // NEW
}
```

### 2. Autonomous Orchestrator
**File:** `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/autonomous/orchestrator.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added imports for both new domain agents
- Registered `DataScientistDomain` as 'data-science'
- Registered `MarketingStrategistDomain` as 'marketing'
- Total agents increased from 3 to 5

**Agent Registration:**
```typescript
const dataScientist = new DataScientistDomain(this.config.globalClearance);
const marketingStrategist = new MarketingStrategistDomain(this.config.globalClearance);

this.agents.set('data-science', dataScientist);
this.agents.set('marketing', marketingStrategist);
```

## Testing

### Compilation Check
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis
npx tsc --noEmit src/autonomous/domains/data-scientist-domain.ts
npx tsc --noEmit src/autonomous/domains/marketing-strategist-domain.ts
```

**Result:** ✅ No errors specific to new agents (pre-existing winston import issue in logger.ts)

### Integration Test
To verify agents are registered:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/autonomous/status
```

Expected response should include:
```json
{
  "agents": 5,
  "agentDomains": [
    "code-optimization",
    "cost-optimization",
    "system-health",
    "data-science",
    "marketing"
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Data Scientist Agent

**Scenario 1: Daily Analysis**
```typescript
// Agent automatically runs when:
// - 24+ hours since last analysis
// - Detects stale metrics

// Generated task:
{
  id: "datascience-daily-analysis-{timestamp}",
  title: "Daily Data Analysis",
  priority: Priority.MEDIUM,
  clearanceRequired: ClearanceLevel.READ_ONLY,
  estimatedCost: 0.30
}
```

**Scenario 2: Anomaly Detection**
```typescript
// Agent detects anomalies and generates:
{
  id: "datascience-anomaly-report-{timestamp}",
  title: "Anomaly Detection: 3 anomalies found",
  priority: Priority.HIGH,
  clearanceRequired: ClearanceLevel.SUGGEST,
  metadata: {
    anomalies: [/* detected anomalies */]
  }
}
```

### Marketing Strategist Agent

**Scenario 1: Campaign Optimization**
```typescript
// Agent identifies underperforming campaigns:
{
  id: "marketing-campaign-opt-{timestamp}",
  title: "Optimize 2 Underperforming Campaigns",
  priority: Priority.HIGH,
  clearanceRequired: ClearanceLevel.SUGGEST,
  recommendations: [
    "Update ad creative with stronger CTA",
    "Reduce email frequency from daily to 3x/week"
  ]
}
```

**Scenario 2: ROI Optimization**
```typescript
// When >15% ROI improvement possible:
{
  id: "marketing-roi-opt-{timestamp}",
  title: "Marketing ROI Optimization",
  priority: Priority.HIGH,
  budgetReallocation: [
    { channel: "Google Ads", increase: 1500 },
    { channel: "Facebook Ads", decrease: 1500 }
  ],
  projectedImpact: { additionalRevenue: 8400 }
}
```

## Safety & Clearance

Both agents follow Jarvis's 5-level clearance system:

**Data Scientist:**
- Most operations: READ_ONLY (0) or SUGGEST (1)
- Model building: MODIFY_SAFE (2)
- Never modifies production data

**Marketing Strategist:**
- All operations: READ_ONLY (0) or SUGGEST (1)
- Only provides recommendations
- Never directly modifies campaigns

**Approval Required:**
- All SUGGEST tasks when autoApprove.suggestionsOnly = false
- All MODIFY_SAFE tasks when autoApprove.modifySafe = false
- Production modifications always require approval

---

## Future Enhancements
