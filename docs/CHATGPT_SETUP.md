## Creating the Custom GPT

### Step 1: Access GPT Builder

1. Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click on your profile ‚Üí "My GPTs"
3. Click "Create a GPT" in the top right

### Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

In the **Configure** tab, set:

#### Name
```
Jarvis AI Assistant
```

#### Description
```
Your AI-powered assistant for music production, marketing analytics, user engagement, workflow automation, and system testing.
```

#### Instructions
```
You are Jarvis, an advanced AI assistant that helps users with:

1. **Music Production**
   - Generate original music from text descriptions
   - Analyze existing tracks (tempo, key, genre, mood)
   - Validate audio quality for production standards

2. **Marketing Analytics**
   - Retrieve performance metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, ROI)
   - Manage marketing campaigns
   - Analyze growth trends and opportunities

3. **User Engagement**
   - Analyze sentiment from feedback and reviews
   - Detect users at risk of churning
   - Create re-engagement campaigns

4. **Workflow Automation**
   - Create and manage automated workflows
   - Generate predictive forecasts
   - Auto-scale resources intelligently

5. **System Testing**
   - Run comprehensive health checks
   - Validate system integrity and data

## Conversation Style

- Be conversational and friendly
- Provide clear, actionable responses
- Explain what actions you're taking and why
- Offer recommendations based on user patterns
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Summarize results in an easy-to-understand format

## When to Use Actions

Use actions for ANY request that involves:
- Generating content (music, forecasts)
- Analyzing data (sentiment, audio, metrics)
- Managing campaigns or workflows
- Checking system health or status
- Retrieving real-time data

## Job Management

Some operations (like music generation or forecasting) are asynchronous:
1. Tell the user the job has started
2. Provide the job ID
3. Explain how to check progress
4. Offer to check status automatically

## Error Handling

If an action fails:
1. Explain what went wrong in simple terms
2. Suggest alternatives or fixes
3. Offer to try again
4. Log the issue for follow-up

## Rate Limits

Be aware of rate limits:
- Music generation: 10/hour (resource intensive)
- Analysis actions: 100/hour
- Query actions: 200/hour
- Job status: 1000/hour

Inform users if they're approaching limits.

## Personalization

- Remember user preferences across the conversation
- Suggest actions based on their usage patterns
- Adapt response detail level to user preference

## Privacy & Security

- Never log sensitive information
- Don't expose API keys or tokens
- Respect user data privacy
```

#### Conversation Starters

Add these starter prompts:

```
üéµ Generate a chill lo-fi hip hop beat
üìä Show me my marketing metrics for this month
üí¨ Analyze sentiment from our recent user feedback
ü§ñ Create a workflow to scale resources automatically
üîç Run a health check on all services
```

### Step 3: Upload Profile Picture

Use a professional logo or avatar for Jarvis (optional but recommended).

## Configuring Actions

### Step 1: Import OpenAPI Schema

1. In the **Configure** tab, scroll to **Actions**
2. Click "Create new action"
3. Click "Import from URL" or "Paste OpenAPI Schema"

#### Option A: Import from URL (Recommended)

If your Jarvis instance is publicly accessible:

```
https://your-jarvis-domain.com/openapi.chatgpt-v31.yaml
```

#### Option B: Paste Schema Directly

1. On your server, get the OpenAPI schema:
```bash
cat /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/integrations/chatgpt/openapi-schema.yaml
```

2. Copy the entire YAML content
3. Paste it into the ChatGPT schema editor

### Step 2: Verify Action Import

After import, you should see 15 actions:

**Music Actions:**
- `generateMusic`
- `analyzeMusic`
- `validateMusic`

**Marketing Actions:**
- `getMarketingMetrics`
- `manageCampaigns`
- `analyzeGrowth`

**Engagement Actions:**
- `analyzeSentiment`
- `detectChurn`
- `createReEngagement`

**Automation Actions:**
- `manageWorkflows`
- `generateForecast`
- `manageScaling`

**Testing Actions:**
- `runHealthChecks`
- `runValidation`

**Job Management:**
- `getJobStatus`

### Step 3: Update Server URLs

In the schema editor, update the server URL:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://your-jarvis-domain.com/integrations/chatgpt
    description: Production server
```

For local testing with ngrok:
```yaml
servers:
  - url: https://your-ngrok-id.ngrok-free.app/integrations/chatgpt
    description: Local development (ngrok)
```

---

## Authentication Setup

### Option 1: API Key Authentication (Recommended for Testing)

1. In the **Actions** section, scroll to **Authentication**
2. Select **API Key**
3. Configure:
   - **Auth Type**: API Key
   - **Header Name**: `Authorization`
   - **Value**: `Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`
   - **Auth Method**: Bearer

4. Get your API token from Jarvis:
```bash
# Check your .env file
cat /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/.env | grep JARVIS_AUTH_TOKEN
```

5. Enter the token in ChatGPT (with "Bearer " prefix)

### Option 2: OAuth (Recommended for Production)

For production deployments:

1. Set up OAuth provider (e.g., Auth0, Okta)
2. Configure OAuth in Actions:
   - **Auth Type**: OAuth
   - **Client ID**: Your OAuth client ID
   - **Client Secret**: Your OAuth client secret
   - **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth authorization endpoint
   - **Token URL**: Your OAuth token endpoint
   - **Scope**: `jarvis:read jarvis:write`

3. Implement OAuth flow in Jarvis (see `/integrations/chatgpt/middleware/auth.ts`)

---

## Testing the Integration

### Step 1: Test in GPT Builder

Before publishing, test each action:

1. Click "Test" in the GPT Builder
2. Try these commands:

```
Generate a happy upbeat pop song

Show my marketing metrics for this week

Analyze sentiment from social media

Run a health check
```

3. Verify:
   - Actions are called correctly
   - Results are formatted well
   - Error messages are clear
   - Job IDs work for async operations

### Step 2: Test Authentication

1. Remove authentication temporarily
2. Try an action - should get 401 Unauthorized
3. Re-add authentication
4. Try again - should work

### Step 3: Test Rate Limiting

1. Try music generation 11 times in quick succession
2. Should get rate limit error on 11th attempt
3. Verify retry-after message is clear

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

On your Jarvis server:

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/logs/jarvis.log

# Check for ChatGPT requests
grep "ChatGPT" /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/logs/jarvis.log
```

---

## Publishing the GPT

### Option 1: Only Me (Private Testing)
1. Click "Save" in top right
2. Select "Only me"
3. Test privately

### Option 2: Anyone with Link (Team Sharing)
1. Click "Save"
2. Select "Anyone with a link"
3. Share link with team

### Option 3: Public (After Testing)
1. Click "Save"
2. Select "Public"
3. Add to GPT Store (optional)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Actions Not Working

**Problem**: Actions fail with 401 Unauthorized

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify Jarvis is running
curl http://localhost:4000/health

# Test ChatGPT endpoint directly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/integrations/chatgpt/
```

**Problem**: Actions fail with CORS errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Update CORS_ORIGIN in .env
echo "CORS_ORIGIN=*" >> /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/.env

# Restart Jarvis
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis && npm run dev
```

### Schema Import Fails

**Problem**: "Invalid OpenAPI schema" error

**Solution**:
```bash
# Validate schema
npx @apidevtools/swagger-cli validate \
  /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/integrations/chatgpt/openapi-schema.yaml

# Check OpenAPI version (must be 3.1.0)
head -n 5 /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/integrations/chatgpt/openapi-schema.yaml
```

### Rate Limits Too Strict

**Problem**: Users hitting rate limits frequently

**Solution**:

Edit `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/integrations/chatgpt/middleware/rate-limit.ts`:

```typescript
// Increase limits
const RATE_LIMITS = {
  'music.generate': 20,  // Was 10
  'music.analyze': 200,  // Was 100
  // ...
};
```

### Job Status Not Updating

**Problem**: Async jobs stuck in "running" state

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check job manager
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/integrations/chatgpt/jobs-stats

# Check AI Dawg backend health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed prompts for music generation
   ```
   ‚ùå "make music"
   ‚úÖ "Generate a 60-second upbeat electronic dance track with synthesizers, 120 BPM"
   ```

2. **Check Job Status**: For long operations, use the job ID to check progress
   ```
   Check the status of job job_music_gen_abc123
   ```

3. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Watch the X-RateLimit headers in responses

4. **Use Context**: Reference previous actions in conversation
   ```
   "Analyze the music I just generated"
   "Create a campaign for that segment we identified"
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check for errors and unusual patterns
   ```bash
   tail -f /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/logs/jarvis.log | grep ERROR
   ```

2. **Track Usage**: Monitor rate limit statistics
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:4000/integrations/chatgpt/jobs-stats
   ```

3. **Rotate API Keys**: Change keys regularly for security
   ```bash
   # Generate new token
   openssl rand -base64 32

   # Update .env
   nano /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/.env
   ```

4. **Backup Contexts**: Export user context data periodically (when implemented)

5. **Update Schema**: When adding new actions, update the OpenAPI schema and re-import in ChatGPT
