- Health check: GET /health returns 200
- Expected time: <5 minutes
- Verify: Service status = RUNNING

// Test 2: ECS auto-scaling
- Simulate high CPU (>80%)
- Expected: Scale from 2 to 5 tasks within 3 minutes
- Verify: All 5 tasks healthy
- Scale down: CPU <40% → Back to 2 tasks

// Test 3: ECS rolling update
- Deploy new version (jarvis:v2)
- Expected: Zero downtime
- Verify: Old tasks drain, new tasks start
- Health check passes before old tasks terminate

// Test 4: ECS deployment failure and rollback
- Deploy broken version (jarvis:broken)
- Health check fails
- Expected: Automatic rollback to previous version
- Verify: Service returns to stable state

// Test 5: ECS load balancer integration
