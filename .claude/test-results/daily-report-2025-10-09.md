## Issues Discovered

### TypeScript Configuration Issue
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Jest test execution fails due to TypeScript ESM module configuration
**Error**: `The 'import.meta' meta-property is only allowed when the '--module' option is 'es2020'...`
**Impact**: Tests are generated but cannot execute until ts-jest config is updated
**Recommended Fix**:
1. Update `jest.config.ts` with proper ESM transformation settings
2. Ensure `tsconfig.json` has `"module": "esnext"` or `"module": "es2022"`
3. Add proper `ts-jest` transformer configuration
