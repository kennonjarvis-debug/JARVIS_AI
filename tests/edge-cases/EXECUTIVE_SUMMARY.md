## Root Cause Analysis

### Authentication Issues (50+ tests)
Many tests failed with 401 (Unauthorized) errors, indicating:
- AI DAWG API requires authentication that tests didn't provide
- Test suite needs to be updated with proper auth tokens
- OR APIs should allow certain operations without auth

**Recommendation:** Add authentication to test suite or clarify which endpoints should be public.

### Service Availability (27 tests)
Beat generation tests returned 404 errors, indicating:
- AI DAWG service may not be running
- API endpoints may have changed
- Services may be behind different ports/paths

**Recommendation:** Verify AI DAWG service is running and accessible.

### Health/Cost Endpoint Failures (32 tests)
All health and cost tests threw exceptions, indicating:
- Dashboard API may not be running
- Jarvis Control Plane may not be accessible
- Network connectivity issues

**Recommendation:** Ensure all services are running before test execution.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)
1. **Fix SQL Injection & XSS Vulnerabilities**
   - Add input sanitization to all user-facing fields
   - Implement parameterized queries
   - Use Content Security Policy headers

2. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to all AI generation endpoints
   - Set reasonable quotas per user/IP
   - Return 429 status for exceeded limits

3. **Add Input Validation**
   - Validate BPM ranges (40-300)
   - Reject NaN/Infinity values
   - Validate all numeric inputs

4. **Fix Health/Cost Endpoints**
   - Debug why endpoints are throwing exceptions
   - Add proper error handling
   - Return meaningful error messages

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)
1. **Add Authentication to Test Suite**
   - Generate test API keys
   - Update test suite with proper auth
   - Re-run tests to get accurate results

2. **Implement Service Discovery**
   - Verify all services are running before tests
   - Skip tests for unavailable services
   - Report service availability

3. **Add Concurrent Request Handling**
   - Test and fix race conditions
   - Implement request queuing
   - Add database transaction locks

### Long-term Actions (Medium Priority)
1. **Comprehensive Input Validation**
   - Add validation for all user inputs
   - Sanitize special characters
   - Limit string lengths

2. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up real-time health monitoring
   - Add alerts for service degradation
   - Track error rates

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Integrate edge case tests into CI/CD
   - Run tests on every commit
   - Block deployments on critical failures
