**Date:** 2025-10-09

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive security tests for the Jarvis AI Control Plane system. The tests are designed to detect and prevent common security vulnerabilities in a defensive manner.

## Test Files

1. **auth-vulnerabilities.test.ts** - Authentication and authorization security tests
   - Tests: VULN-001 to VULN-016
   - Coverage: JWT validation, token comparison, role-based access, session management

2. **injection-vulnerabilities.test.ts** - Injection attack prevention tests
   - Tests: VULN-017 to VULN-030
   - Coverage: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, NoSQL injection, XXE, SSTI

3. **rate-limit-vulnerabilities.test.ts** - Rate limiting and DoS prevention tests
   - Tests: VULN-031 to VULN-051
   - Coverage: Rate limit bypass, IP spoofing, distributed rate limiting, memory exhaustion

4. **sensitive-data-vulnerabilities.test.ts** - Data exposure and leakage tests
   - Tests: VULN-052 to VULN-077
   - Coverage: Secret exposure, PII leakage, error message disclosure, cookie security

5. **csrf-vulnerabilities.test.ts** - Cross-site request forgery tests
   - Tests: VULN-078 to VULN-101
   - Coverage: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, Origin validation, state-changing operations

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# From project root
./tests/security/orchestrator-generated/run-security-tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx jest tests/security/orchestrator-generated/auth-vulnerabilities.test.ts

# Run all security tests
npx jest tests/security/orchestrator-generated/

# Run with coverage
npx jest tests/security/orchestrator-generated/ --coverage
```

### Continuous Integration

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-tests.yml
name: Security Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: ./tests/security/orchestrator-generated/run-security-tests.sh
```

## Vulnerability Classification

### Critical (Immediate Action Required)
- **VULN-010**: JWT validation bypass - accepts any 3-part string
- **VULN-036**: Rate limiting disabled in development mode
- **VULN-048**: Rate limiting bypassed on errors
- **VULN-058**: CORS set to wildcard (*)
- **VULN-078-101**: No CSRF protection implemented

### High (Fix Within 1 Week)
- **VULN-002**: Timing attack on token comparison
- **VULN-008**: JWT payload validation missing
- **VULN-011**: Development mode authentication bypass
- **VULN-020**: XSS in module execution
- **VULN-034**: Race conditions in rate limiting
- **VULN-037**: Memory exhaustion via rate limit store

### Medium (Fix Within 1 Month)
- Multiple injection vulnerabilities
- Weak API key validation
- Session token storage issues
- Missing input sanitization

### Low (Fix as Resources Allow)
- Information disclosure
- Rate limit header leakage
- Logging improvements

## Security Test Results

Tests are designed to:
1. ✅ **PASS** if security controls are working correctly
2. ❌ **FAIL** if vulnerabilities are detected
3. ⚠️ **WARN** if potential issues are found

**Note:** Some tests are designed to fail initially as they document existing vulnerabilities. Use the SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md to track remediation progress.

## Fixing Vulnerabilities

See `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for:
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Severity ratings
- Code examples for fixes
- Remediation priorities
- Estimated fix times

## Best Practices

### Before Deployment
1. Run all security tests
2. Review and fix CRITICAL vulnerabilities
3. Address HIGH priority issues
4. Document accepted risks for MEDIUM/LOW issues

### Regular Security Audits
- Run security tests before each release
- Review new code for security issues
- Update tests as new vulnerabilities are discovered
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Before committing
npm test -- tests/security/

# Before deploying
./tests/security/orchestrator-generated/run-security-tests.sh

# Review findings
cat tests/security/orchestrator-generated/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

## Test Architecture

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual security functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test security controls in context
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure fixes don't break
- **Compliance Tests**: Verify OWASP/PCI DSS requirements

### Test Categories
1. **Authentication**: User identity verification
2. **Authorization**: Access control and permissions
3. **Input Validation**: Injection prevention
4. **Rate Limiting**: DoS protection
5. **Data Protection**: Sensitive information handling
6. **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Metrics to Track
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Injection attempt patterns
- Unusual API usage
- Error rates in security middleware

### Logging Security Events
```typescript
// Example security event logging
logger.security('auth_failure', {
  userId: user?.id,
  ip: req.ip,
  reason: 'invalid_token',
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

## Dependencies

Required packages:
- `@jest/globals` - Test framework
- `supertest` - HTTP testing (for integration tests)

Install with:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @jest/globals supertest @types/supertest
```

## Contributing

When adding new security tests:
1. Follow the existing naming convention (VULN-XXX)
2. Include severity rating in comments
3. Add test to appropriate file
4. Update SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md
5. Add to run-security-tests.sh if needed
