## How to Proceed

### Option 1: Parallel Execution (RECOMMENDED - 4-5 hours)

Open 4-5 Claude Code instances simultaneously:

**Instance 1:**
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis-v0
# Read: INSTANCE_1_PROMPT.md
# Build: Buffer Integration
```

**Instance 3:**
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis-v0
# Read: INSTANCE_3_PROMPT.md
# Build: Email Integration
```

**Instance 4:**
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis-v0
# Read: INSTANCE_4_PROMPT.md
# Build: HubSpot Integration
```

**Instance 5:**
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis-v0
# Read: INSTANCE_5_PROMPT.md
# Build: n8n Integration
```

**Wait for Instance 3 (Email) to reach 50%, then start Instance 2:**
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis-v0
# Build: Approval Queue (Prompt 11)
# Depends on Email integration
```

### Option 2: Sequential Execution (16-20 hours)

Build one at a time in this order:
1. Email (P8) - 4h (most dependencies)
2. Buffer (P6) - 4h
3. HubSpot (P7) - 4h
4. n8n (P9) - 3h
5. Approval Queue (P11) - 6h

---

## What Each Instance Needs

### All Instances Need:
- Access to completed utilities (Logger, Error Handler)
- Access to Type definitions
- Ability to create files in `src/integrations/`
- Ability to run tests with `npm test`

### API Keys Needed (for testing):
- **Buffer:** BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN
- **HubSpot:** HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN + HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID
- **SendGrid:** SENDGRID_API_KEY
- **n8n:** N8N_API_URL + N8N_API_KEY (or run locally)

### Time Estimates:
- Buffer: 4 hours
- HubSpot: 4 hours
- Email: 4 hours
- n8n: 3 hours
- **Total if parallel:** 4-5 hours
- **Total if sequential:** 15-16 hours

## Success Criteria for Wave 2

Before moving to Wave 3, verify:

- [ ] All 5 integrations complete (Buffer, HubSpot, Email, n8n, Approval Queue)
- [ ] All tests passing (>85% coverage each)
- [ ] Documentation complete for each
- [ ] Can send email via SendGrid
- [ ] Can create post via Buffer
- [ ] Can create contact via HubSpot
- [ ] Can trigger n8n workflow
- [ ] Can create approval request
- [ ] All components use Logger and ErrorHandler
- [ ] No blocking errors in `npm test`

---

## Testing Each Component

### Buffer
```bash
npm test src/integrations/buffer.test.ts
```

### HubSpot
```bash
npm test src/integrations/hubspot.test.ts
```

### Email
```bash
npm test src/integrations/email.test.ts
```

### n8n
```bash
npm test src/integrations/n8n.test.ts
```

### Approval Queue
```bash
npm test src/core/approval-queue.test.ts
```

---

## Integration Test (After Wave 2)

Create `tests/integration/wave2-integration.test.ts`:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { BufferAdapter } from '../../src/integrations/buffer';
import { HubSpotAdapter } from '../../src/integrations/hubspot';
import { EmailAdapter } from '../../src/integrations/email';
import { N8nAdapter } from '../../src/integrations/n8n';
import { ApprovalQueue } from '../../src/core/approval-queue';

describe('Wave 2 Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should integrate all Wave 2 components', async () => {
    // Test that all integrations work together
    // E.g., Create lead in HubSpot → Send email → Post to social → Log in Supabase
  });
});
```

---

## After Wave 2: Moving to Wave 3

Once Wave 2 is complete, Wave 3 will build:

1. **Decision Engine** (6h) - Risk assessment and routing
2. **Marketing Agent** (5h) - Social media, content, campaigns
3. **Sales & Support Agents** (6h) - Lead management, customer service
4. **Operations & Orchestrator** (8h) - Monitoring, coordination

**Total Wave 3:** 25-30 hours (with some parallelization: 12-15 hours)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail
```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run typecheck

# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/integrations/buffer.test.ts

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- --reporter=verbose
```

### If Dependencies Missing
```bash
npm install
```

### If Types Not Found
```bash
# Ensure types are exported from src/types/index.ts
cat src/types/index.ts
```

---

## Communication Between Instances

### If Working in Parallel

**Coordinate via git:**
```bash
# Before starting work
git pull origin main

# After completing component
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Prompt X: [Component]"
git push origin main
```

**Or work in separate branches:**
```bash
# Instance 1
git checkout -b prompt-6-buffer

# Instance 3
git checkout -b prompt-8-email

# Merge after completion
git checkout main
git merge prompt-6-buffer
git merge prompt-8-email
```

---

## Questions to Ask Before Starting

1. **Do you want to run all 4-5 instances in parallel?**
   - Yes → Fastest (4-5 hours total)
   - No → Sequential (15-16 hours total)

2. **Do you have API keys available?**
   - Buffer, HubSpot, SendGrid/Brevo
   - Can work without keys (tests use mocks)

3. **Which approach?**
   - Follow Parallel Execution Guide (JARVIS_DESIGN_AND_PROMPTS.md)
   - OR follow Stage-based approach (Complete Build Guide)

---

## Recommended Next Command

### For Parallel Execution:

**In Terminal 1:**
```bash
claude code "Build Prompt 6: Buffer Integration. Read INSTANCE_1_PROMPT.md and implement the Buffer API adapter following the specifications."
```

**In Terminal 2:**
```bash
claude code "Build Prompt 8: Email Integration. Read INSTANCE_3_PROMPT.md and implement the Email adapter with SendGrid following the specifications."
```

**In Terminal 3:**
```bash
claude code "Build Prompt 7: HubSpot Integration. Read INSTANCE_4_PROMPT.md and implement the HubSpot CRM adapter following the specifications."
```

**In Terminal 4:**
```bash
claude code "Build Prompt 9: n8n Integration. Read INSTANCE_5_PROMPT.md and implement the n8n workflow adapter following the specifications."
```
