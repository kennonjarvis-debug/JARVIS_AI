# Quick Start - Parallel Development

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Master Plan**: See `PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md`

## Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Git Branches

```bash
# JARVIS branches
cd ~/Jarvis-v0
git branch langgraph-feature
git branch integration-feature

# DAWG AI - Initialize git if needed
cd ~/Development/DAWG_AI
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Phase 1 complete"
git branch frontend-feature
git branch audio-engine-feature
git branch midi-voice-feature
```

### Step 2: Create Worktrees

```bash
# JARVIS worktrees (Instance 5)
cd ~/Jarvis-v0
git worktree add ../jarvis-langgraph langgraph-feature
git worktree add ../jarvis-integration integration-feature

# DAWG AI worktrees (Instances 2, 3, 4)
cd ~/Development/DAWG_AI
git worktree add ../dawg-frontend frontend-feature
git worktree add ../dawg-audio-engine audio-engine-feature
git worktree add ../dawg-midi-voice midi-voice-feature
```

### Step 3: Copy Master Plan to Each Worktree

```bash
# Copy to all worktrees
cp ~/Jarvis-v0/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md ~/jarvis-langgraph/
cp ~/Jarvis-v0/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md ~/jarvis-integration/
cp ~/Jarvis-v0/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md ~/dawg-frontend/
cp ~/Jarvis-v0/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md ~/dawg-audio-engine/
cp ~/Jarvis-v0/PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md ~/dawg-midi-voice/
```

## Development Workflow

### Daily Updates

Each instance updates `~/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`:

```markdown
# Development Status - [Date]

## Instance 2 (DAWG Frontend)
- ✅ Completed today: [What was done]
- 🔄 In progress: [What's being worked on]
- ⏳ Blocked by: [Any blockers]
- 📅 Tomorrow: [Next tasks]

## Instance 3 (DAWG Audio)
...

## Instance 4 (DAWG MIDI/Voice)
...

## Instance 5 (JARVIS LangGraph)
...

## Instance 6 (Integration)
...
```

### Weekly Integration

**Every Sunday at 6 PM**:
1. All instances commit and push to their branches
2. Create PRs to main branches
3. Run integration tests
4. Fix conflicts
5. Merge if all tests pass

### Communication

- **Async**: Update `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` daily
- **Sync**: Weekly video call (optional)
- **Blockers**: Tag in `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` immediately
- **Questions**: Add to `QUESTIONS.md` in main repo

---

## API Contracts

### DAWG AI Backend (Port 9000) ✅ Already Running

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/generate/midi` - Generate drums/melody/bass
- `POST /api/v1/generate/bassline` - Generate bassline
- `POST /api/v1/generate/melody` - Generate melody
- `POST /api/v1/mixing/suggest` - Get mixing suggestions

**Test it**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}
```

### JARVIS API (Port 3000) ✅ Already Running

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/agents/activities` - Recent agent actions
- `GET /api/agents/metrics` - Agent performance metrics
- `POST /api/agents/approve/:id` - Approve action
- `POST /api/agents/reject/:id` - Reject action

**Test it**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should return: {"success":true,"status":"healthy"}
```

### Integration Points

**JARVIS → DAWG AI**:
- JARVIS voice commands can trigger DAWG AI generation
- Example: "Generate a beat" → calls `localhost:9000/api/v1/generate/midi`

**DAWG AI → JARVIS**:
- DAWG AI project status updates shown in Observatory
- Create DAWG Monitor Agent (similar to iMessage agent)

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts

**JARVIS API (3000)**:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
cd ~/Jarvis-v0
npm run api
```

**DAWG AI Backend (9000)**:
```bash
lsof -ti:9000 | xargs kill -9
cd ~/Development/DAWG_AI
python main.py
```

**Observatory Dashboard (5174)**:
```bash
cd ~/Jarvis-v0/observatory
npm run dev
```

### Git Worktree Issues

**List all worktrees**:
```bash
cd ~/Jarvis-v0
git worktree list
```

**Remove a worktree**:
```bash
git worktree remove ../jarvis-langgraph
```

**Prune stale worktrees**:
```bash
git worktree prune
```

### Claude Code Issues

**Reset context**:
```bash
# In the worktree directory
rm -rf .claude/
```

**Check available tools**:
```bash
claude code --help
```

## Emergency Contacts

If you get completely stuck:

1. **Check `PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER.md`** for detailed prompts
2. **Review API contracts** to ensure compatibility
3. **Check `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`** for what other instances are doing
4. **Ask in `QUESTIONS.md`** for help from other instances
5. **Restart with fresh prompt** if Claude Code gets confused
