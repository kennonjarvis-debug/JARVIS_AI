## Critical Gaps (Must Fix)

### 1. Music Generation Completely Disconnected

**Current State:**
```typescript
// src/services/music-generator.ts
async generateMusic(options: GenerateMusicOptions): Promise<MusicGenerationResult> {
  const id = `music-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`;
  return {
    id,
    audioUrl: `https://example.com/music/${id}.mp3`, // FAKE
    localPath: `/tmp/music/${id}.mp3`,
    // ...
  };
}
```

**Problem:** Returns mock result only, no real audio generation

**Impact:** 
- Users can't generate music
- Chat system can't offer music feature
- DAW integration impossible
- No backend infrastructure

**Fix Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks entire music feature

**To Fix:**
1. Implement real music provider integration (Suno/Replicate)
2. Actually generate audio files
3. Store files persistently (S3 or local)
4. Wire to chat system for user notification

---

### 2. Chat-to-Music Intent Gap

**Current State:**
```typescript
// src/core/gateway.ts - POST /api/v1/chat
// If user says "generate music", it goes to text AI
// AI responds with text: "Sure, I can help with that!"
// That's it. No actual music generation.
```

**Problem:** No intent detection for music requests

**Impact:**
- Music requests treated as regular chat
- No routing to music generator
- Users get text response instead of audio
- DAW features inaccessible via chat

**Fix Priority:** CRITICAL - Breaks core feature

**To Fix:**
1. Add intent classifier to chat handler
2. Detect music-related keywords
3. Route to music generator service
4. Stream results back to user

---

### 3. Activity Monitor ↔ DAW Disconnected

**Current State:**
```typescript
// src/main.ts - Activity monitor detects freestyle
activityMonitor.on('session:ended', async (session) => {
  // Detects: "Freestyling ended in Logic Pro"
  // Creates opportunity: "Auto-finish freestyle"
  // Then... nothing. Dead end.
  // No connection to:
  // - Chat system (no notification)
  // - Music generation (no auto-finish)
  // - DAW service (no feedback)
});
```

**Problem:** Event fires but nothing happens

**Impact:**
- Proactive features don't work
- Audio captured but not used
- Music generation not triggered
- User never notified

**Fix Priority:** CRITICAL - Breaks automation

**To Fix:**
1. Wire session end event to autonomous orchestrator
2. Create "music-production" domain agent task
3. Trigger music generation with context
4. Notify user in chat with result

---

### 4. Plugin System Missing Entirely

**Current State:**
```
No plugin interface exists
No plugin loader exists
No hook system exists
No third-party extensibility
```

**Problem:** Complete absence

**Impact:**
- Can't add custom music generators
- Can't extend chat capabilities
- Can't integrate third-party services
- Locked-in to built-in features only

**Fix Priority:** HIGH - Limits extensibility

**To Fix:**
1. Define `IPlugin` interface with hooks
2. Implement plugin loader
3. Add plugin registry
4. Document plugin API

---

### 5. Event System Fragmented

**Current State:**
```typescript
// Scattered EventEmitters
ActivityMonitorService extends EventEmitter
AutonomousOrchestrator extends EventEmitter
BusinessOperator extends EventEmitter

// But:
// - Local only (not distributed)
// - No central event bus
// - Hard to subscribe across services
// - WebSocket Hub is separate
// - No correlation between events
```

**Problem:** No unified event infrastructure

**Impact:**
- Difficult to wire services together
- Events can be lost
- No event replay for debugging
- Multi-instance systems fragile

**Fix Priority:** HIGH - Architectural foundation

**To Fix:**
1. Create central EventBus interface
2. Implement Redis-backed event store
3. Add event versioning
4. Implement event replay

---

### 6. Storage Layer Fragmented

**Current State:**
```
Generated music → /tmp/music/{id}.mp3 (TEMP - LOST!)
Conversations → PostgreSQL
Activity logs → /Users/.../data/activity-logs
Screenshots → $STORAGE_PATH/screenshots
Audio samples → $STORAGE_PATH/audio
Music projects → PostgreSQL + DAWG AI
```

**Problem:** Multiple backends, no abstraction

**Impact:**
- Generated files not persisted properly
- Hard to migrate storage
- S3 backup not integrated with music
- No CDN/delivery infrastructure
- Fragile, hard to scale

**Fix Priority:** HIGH - Data loss risk

**To Fix:**
1. Create unified storage abstraction
2. Support multiple backends (LocalFS, S3, Azure)
3. Integrate with backup system
4. Add CDN support for audio delivery

---

## High Priority Improvements

### 7. Service Initialization & Dependency Injection

**Current State:**
- Direct instantiation + singleton pattern
- No formal DI container
- Services don't declare dependencies
- Initialization order is fragile

**Recommendation:**
- Implement formal DI (tsyringe)
- Declare service dependencies
- Validate initialization order
- Add service registry

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High

---

### 8. Error Context & Correlation IDs

**Current State:**
```typescript
// When music generation fails:
// Service fails silently or returns generic error
// Chat system doesn't know what went wrong
// No correlation between services
```

**Recommendation:**
- Add correlation IDs to all requests
- Pass error context between services
- Implement distributed tracing
- Add better logging

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High

---

### 9. AI Provider Capabilities

**Current State:**
- Multi-provider routing works
- Cost tracking works
- But:
  - No streaming support
  - No vision/multimodal
  - No audio input
  - No activity context

**Recommendation:**
- Add streaming responses
- Implement multimodal support
- Add audio input processing
- Feed activity context to chat

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** High

---

### 10. Integration Tests

**Current State:**
- Unit tests exist
- No integration tests for cross-service flows
- No event propagation tests
- No failure scenario tests

**Recommendation:**
- Create integration test suite
- Test full service flows
- Test error handling
- Test multi-instance scenarios

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium

## Success Criteria

Once implemented, these metrics should improve:

**Feature Completeness:**
- ✅ Chat → Music generation pipeline works
- ✅ Activity monitor → DAW operations works
- ✅ Users can upload/register plugins
- ✅ Generated files persist across restarts

**System Reliability:**
- ✅ Service failures don't cascade
- ✅ Errors propagate with context
- ✅ Requests can be traced end-to-end
- ✅ Events reliably delivered

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Cross-service tests pass
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Clear service contracts
- ✅ Documented plugin API

---

## Conclusion

The Jarvis system has **excellent infrastructure** (API gateway, health monitoring, circuit breakers) but **critical gaps** in service integration. The main issues are:

1. **Music generation is a stub** - Needs real implementation
2. **Chat-to-music bridge missing** - Can't detect intent
3. **Activity-to-DAW gap** - Events don't propagate
4. **Plugin system absent** - Can't extend
5. **Event system fragmented** - Scattered EventEmitters

**Recommended approach:** Start with the three critical fixes (music gen, chat bridge, activity bridge) then move to infrastructure improvements (event bus, plugin system). This will unblock core features first, then make the system more extensible and maintainable.

All gaps are **fixable** - this isn't a design problem, just incomplete implementation. The foundation is solid.
