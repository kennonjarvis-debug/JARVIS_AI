### Daily Resource Consumption
- API Calls: 150-200
- Tokens: 50,000-60,000
- Cost: $1.50-2.00
- CPU: 500ms-2s aggregate
- Memory: <100MB peak

### Success Rates

## Key Findings

### Strengths
✓ Sophisticated, well-designed architecture
✓ Robust security with 5-tier clearance system
✓ Comprehensive resource tracking
✓ Event-driven real-time coordination
✓ High success rates (92-98%)
✓ Low operational costs ($1.50-2.00/day)
✓ Extensible framework for new agents
✓ Autonomous decision-making within safety constraints

### Areas for Improvement
⚠️ Persistent memory between runs (planned)
⚠️ Inter-agent communication (currently through orchestrator)
⚠️ Clearance granularity (5 levels may need refinement)
⚠️ Error recovery patterns (limited retry logic)
⚠️ Production monitoring dashboards (need enhancement)

### Maturity Assessment
**Overall Score: 7.5/10**
- Architecture: 9/10
- Code Quality: 8/10
- Features: 8/10
- Security: 8/10
- Production Readiness: 7.5/10

---

## Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment
1. Enable comprehensive audit logging
2. Set up monitoring dashboard
3. Establish alert thresholds
4. Document emergency procedures
5. Create backup/recovery procedures

### First 30 Days
1. Deploy with monitoring
2. Track all metrics
3. Test failover procedures
4. Gather operational feedback
5. Optimize based on real usage

### Next Quarter
1. Add distributed tracing
2. Implement circuit breaker pattern
3. Create advanced memory layer
4. Build predictive scaling
5. Develop Phase 2 agents (DevOps, QA, Creative)
