## Executive Summary

This document integrates real-world workflows from 2025 DevOps/SRE practices and professional music production into our AI testing system. Tests generated by Claude Code agents will now validate **real-world scenarios** instead of theoretical ones.

**Key Findings**:
- DevOps incident response now happens in **<2 days** (45% exfiltrate data in <1 day)
- SRE teams use **Four Golden Signals**: latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- Pro Tools remains the **industry standard DAW** for professional studios
- Professional mixing sessions take **1 day to 1 week** with specific editing routines

## Part 1: Real-World DevOps/SRE Workflows (JARVIS)

### 1.1 Current State of Production Monitoring (2025)

#### Critical Metrics
Based on Google SRE and industry standards, modern monitoring focuses on:

**Four Golden Signals**:
1. **Latency**: How long it takes to service a request
2. **Traffic**: How much demand is being placed on your system
3. **Errors**: The rate of requests that fail
4. **Saturation**: How "full" your service is (CPU, memory, disk, I/O)

**Three Pillars of Observability**:
1. **Metrics**: Numerical measurements (CPU %, response time, request count)
2. **Logs**: Detailed event records with timestamps
3. **Traces**: Request journey across services (correlation IDs)

#### Industry Tools (2025)
1. **Datadog**: Complete observability (infrastructure, APM, logs, security)
2. **PagerDuty**: Incident response with real-time context
3. **Splunk**: AI-powered anomaly detection
4. **Prometheus + Grafana**: Open-source metrics and dashboards

### 1.2 Incident Response Workflow

#### Detection Phase (0-5 minutes)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Automated monitoring detects anomaly
     - Service latency >100ms (p95)
     - Error rate >0.1%
     - Saturation >80% (CPU/memory/disk)

  2. Alert system triggers
     - PagerDuty sends notification
     - Includes correlation ID for tracing
     - Contains relevant context (service, error, metrics)

  3. On-call engineer receives alert
     - Mobile push notification
     - SMS backup
     - Email (lowest priority)

Real-world timing:
  - Alert fires: Within 30 seconds of threshold breach
  - Engineer notified: Within 60 seconds
  - Engineer acknowledges: Target <5 minutes
```

#### Investigation Phase (5-20 minutes)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Check dashboard for service health
     - View Four Golden Signals for affected service
     - Check dependency map (upstream/downstream services)
     - Review recent deployments (last 24 hours)

  2. Trace request with correlation ID
     - See all service hops
     - Identify slow/failing service
     - View error details and stack traces

  3. Review logs (last 100 entries)
     - Filter by severity (ERROR, WARN)
     - Search for error patterns
     - Check for related alerts

  4. Escalate if needed
     - Runbook defines escalation path
     - Bring in subject matter experts
     - Create incident war room (Slack/Teams)

Real-world timing:
  - Initial triage: 5-10 minutes
  - Root cause identified: 10-20 minutes
```

#### Resolution Phase (20-60 minutes)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Automated recovery (if available)
     - Restart failed pods in Kubernetes
     - Scale resources during traffic spike
     - Block suspicious IPs during security breach
     - Circuit breaker isolates failing service

  2. Manual intervention (if automated fails)
     - Execute runbook steps
     - Restart service manually
     - Rollback recent deployment
     - Apply hotfix

  3. Verify recovery
     - Service returns to healthy state
     - Four Golden Signals within SLO
     - Verify data integrity (no data loss)
     - Monitor for 15-30 minutes for stability

Real-world timing:
  - Automated recovery: 1-5 minutes
  - Manual recovery: 20-60 minutes
  - Verification: 15-30 minutes
```

#### Post-Incident Phase (24-48 hours after)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Postmortem (blameless culture)
     - Timeline of events
     - Root cause analysis
     - What went well / what didn't
     - Action items to prevent recurrence

  2. Update runbooks
     - Add new scenarios discovered
     - Improve escalation procedures
     - Document workarounds

  3. Adjust monitoring
     - Add new alerts if gap discovered
     - Tune alert thresholds (reduce noise)
     - Add dashboards for new metrics

Real-world timing:
  - Postmortem meeting: Within 24-48 hours
  - Runbook updates: Within 1 week
  - Monitoring improvements: Within 2 weeks
```

### 1.3 SLO-Based Monitoring Workflow

```yaml
Define SLOs (Service Level Objectives):
  Example for JARVIS Gateway:
    - Availability: 99.9% uptime (43 minutes downtime/month allowed)
    - Latency: p95 < 100ms
    - Error rate: < 0.1%
    - Throughput: Handle 1000 req/sec

Define SLIs (Service Level Indicators):
  Metrics to measure:
    - % of requests successful (availability)
    - Response time at p50, p95, p99 (latency)
    - % of requests returning 5xx errors
    - Requests per second (throughput)

Monitor Error Budget:
  Calculation:
    - SLO: 99.9% availability = 0.1% error budget
    - If error rate exceeds 0.1%, error budget depleted
    - When depleted: Freeze deployments, focus on reliability

Weekly Review:
  - Check error budget burn rate
  - Forecast if budget will last the month
  - Prioritize reliability work if budget low
```

### 1.4 Deployment Workflow (Blue-Green)

```yaml
Pre-Deployment (15 minutes):
  1. Run automated tests in staging
     - Unit tests: 500+ tests
     - Integration tests: 50+ scenarios
     - Performance tests: Load test at 2x peak traffic

  2. Review change log
     - What's being deployed
     - Who approved it
     - Rollback plan

Deployment (30 minutes):
  1. Deploy to Green environment
     - Keep Blue (current) running
     - Deploy new version to Green
     - Wait for health checks to pass

  2. Run smoke tests on Green
     - Health check: GET /health returns 200
     - Critical endpoints: Test 5-10 key APIs
     - Database connectivity: Verify migrations

  3. Switch 10% traffic to Green (canary)
     - Monitor Four Golden Signals for 10 minutes
     - Compare Green vs Blue metrics
     - Check error rates and latency

  4. Switch 100% traffic to Green
     - Full cutover
     - Blue remains on standby for rollback

  5. Monitor for 30 minutes
     - Watch error rates
     - Check latency
     - Review user reports

Post-Deployment (24 hours):
  - Monitor metrics for 24 hours
  - If stable, decommission Blue
  - If issues, rollback to Blue (instant)
```

## Part 2: Real-World Music Production Workflows (AI DAWG)

### 2.1 Pro Tools Professional Recording Session

#### Pre-Session Setup (30 minutes)
```yaml
1. Create session from template
   - Sample rate: 48kHz (standard for video) or 44.1kHz (for music)
   - Bit depth: 24-bit (professional quality)
   - I/O settings: Configure for audio interface
   - Format: Stereo or surround sound

2. Set up tracks
   - Audio tracks: Mono for single mics, stereo for instruments
   - MIDI tracks: For virtual instruments
   - Aux tracks: For effects buses
   - Master track: For final output

3. Configure routing
   - Input assignments: Assign mics to tracks
   - Output routing: Route tracks to buses
   - Send routing: Create reverb/delay buses
   - Monitor mix: Headphone mix for artists

4. Load plugins
   - EQ presets for vocals/instruments
   - Compression chains
   - Reverb/delay effects
   - De-esser, tuning plugins

Template saves 15-30 minutes per session!
```

#### Recording Phase (1-3 hours)
```yaml
Vocal Recording Workflow:
  1. Sound check (10 minutes)
     - Set input gain (avoid clipping, -6dB headroom)
     - Test microphone signal
     - Adjust headphone mix
     - Enable metronome/click track

  2. Record guide vocal (15 minutes)
     - Full take, don't stop for mistakes
     - Gets artist comfortable
     - Establishes phrasing and energy

  3. Playlist recording (multiple takes)
     - Record 3-5 complete takes
     - Pro Tools saves all takes in playlist
     - Mark best sections during recording
     - Comp (composite) the best parts later

  4. Punch in/out for fixes (30 minutes)
     - Identify problem sections
     - Set punch in/out points (specific time ranges)
     - Record just those sections
     - Seamless replacement

  5. Add effects during recording (optional)
     - Light compression (3:1 ratio, gentle)
     - Reverb for artist comfort (not printed)
     - Auto-tuning (real-time pitch correction)

Real-world timing:
  - Lead vocal: 1-2 hours
  - Background vocals: 30-60 minutes per part
  - Instruments: 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on complexity
```

#### Editing Phase (1-2 hours)
```yaml
Professional Editing Workflow:
  1. Comping (30 minutes)
     - Review all takes in playlist
     - Select best phrase from each take
     - Create composite "perfect" take

  2. Timing correction (30 minutes)
     - Align to grid (quantize to tempo)
     - Slip notes/words to correct timing
     - Use Elastic Audio for stretching/compressing

  3. Pitch correction (15 minutes)
     - Auto-Tune or Melodyne
     - Correct off-pitch notes (>Â±15 cents)
     - Preserve natural vibrato

  4. Cleanup (15 minutes)
     - Remove breaths, pops, clicks
     - Fade in/out clips to avoid pops
     - Strip silence (remove dead air)

  5. Arrangement (30 minutes)
     - Copy/paste sections (verse, chorus)
     - Build structure (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)
     - Create transitions

Editing is what separates amateur from professional sound!
```

### 2.2 Mixing Workflow (1 Day to 1 Week)

#### Initial Mix (Day 1: 4-6 hours)
```yaml
1. Gain staging (30 minutes)
   - Set all faders to unity (0dB)
   - Adjust input gain so no clipping
   - Create rough balance (vocals, drums, bass, instruments)
   - Leave headroom (-6dB on master for mastering)

2. EQ (1 hour)
   - Remove unwanted frequencies
   - Vocals: High-pass filter <80Hz, boost presence 2-5kHz
   - Bass: Boost sub 40-80Hz, cut mud 200-400Hz
   - Drums: Boost kick 60Hz + 3kHz, snare 200Hz + 5kHz
   - Parametric EQ: 4-band minimum

3. Compression (1 hour)
   - Control dynamics (quiet parts louder, loud parts quieter)
   - Vocals: 3:1 to 6:1 ratio, fast attack, medium release
   - Bass: 4:1 ratio, medium attack/release
   - Drums: Parallel compression (blend compressed + uncompressed)

4. Panning (15 minutes)
   - Create stereo width
   - Vocals/bass/kick: Center (0)
   - Guitars: Hard left (-100) and right (+100)
   - Background vocals: -30 to +30
   - Hi-hats, percussion: Slight pan for space

5. Effects (1 hour)
   - Reverb: Room for drums, Hall for vocals, Plate for snare
   - Delay: 1/4 note for vocal echoes, slap delay for depth
   - Bus routing: Send multiple tracks to same reverb (saves CPU)

6. Automation (30 minutes)
   - Volume rides: Bring vocals forward in chorus
   - Effect automation: Increase reverb on last chorus
   - Panning automation: Create movement
```

#### Mix Refinement (Days 2-5)
```yaml
Day 2-3: Detail work (8-12 hours total)
  - Fine-tune EQ (cut instead of boost for clarity)
  - Adjust compression attack/release times
  - Add saturation/distortion for warmth
  - Master channel processing (limiter, maximizer)

Day 4: Fresh ears review (2-4 hours)
  - Take 24-hour break, return with fresh ears
  - Listen on multiple speakers (monitors, headphones, car, phone)
  - Reference against commercial tracks
  - Make final adjustments

Day 5: Bounce to disk (30 minutes)
  - Export stereo mix (WAV 24-bit, 48kHz)
  - Also export stems (separate tracks for mastering engineer)
  - Include metadata (artist, title, genre, ISRC code)
```

### 2.3 Collaboration Workflow (Real-Time)

```yaml
Modern Pro Tools Collaboration (Avid Cloud):
  1. Share session via cloud
     - Upload session to Avid Cloud
     - Generate share link (public or private)
     - Set permissions: View, Comment, Edit

  2. Real-time editing
     - See other users' cursors
     - See live edits from collaborators
     - Conflict resolution: Last write wins
     - Chat with collaborators in-app

  3. Version control
     - Auto-save every 5 minutes
     - Save as new version for major changes
     - Track who viewed/edited with timestamps
     - Revert to previous versions if needed

  4. Review and approval
     - Add comments to specific sections
     - Mark sections for revision
     - Approve final mix
     - Export and distribute

Real-world usage:
  - Producer in LA, engineer in NYC work simultaneously
  - Artist reviews mix remotely, leaves time-stamped comments
  - Changes visible within seconds
```

## Part 3: How Claude Code Spawns Agents (Technical Explanation)

### 3.1 The Task Tool Mechanism

Claude Code has a built-in **Task tool** that allows one instance to spawn specialized agents. Here's how it works:

#### Basic Task Tool Syntax
```typescript
Task tool invocation:
{
  description: "Short 3-5 word description",
  prompt: "Detailed instructions for the agent",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose" | "statusline-setup" | "output-style-setup"
}
```

#### What Happens When You Call Task Tool
```
1. Instance 8 (Coordinator) calls Task tool
   â
2. Claude Code spawns a NEW agent (separate context)
   â
3. Agent receives the prompt as its task
   â
4. Agent has access to tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
   â
5. Agent works autonomously (no back-and-forth with Instance 8)
   â
6. Agent completes task and returns FINAL report to Instance 8
   â
7. Instance 8 receives report and continues orchestrating
```

#### Key Characteristics
- **Stateless**: Each agent invocation is independent (no memory between tasks)
- **Autonomous**: Agent works without asking Instance 8 for clarification
- **One response**: Agent returns ONE final message, then terminates
- **Parallel capable**: Instance 8 can spawn multiple agents simultaneously

### 3.2 Real Example: Unit Test Agent

#### Instance 8 Calls Task Tool
```typescript
// Instance 8 running in terminal 1
I'll spawn a unit test agent to generate tests for health-aggregator.ts...

[Uses Task tool]
Task(
  description: "Generate unit tests",
  prompt: `You are a unit testing expert for a DevOps monitoring system.

CONTEXT:
You are testing JARVIS, a production monitoring system that manages AI DAWG services.
Real-world context: DevOps teams respond to incidents in <5 minutes, monitor Four Golden Signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation), and use automated recovery.

YOUR TASK:
Generate comprehensive unit tests for /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/core/health-aggregator.ts

REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS TO TEST:
Based on 2025 DevOps best practices, test these scenarios:

1. Four Golden Signals Monitoring:
   - Latency: Service responds in <100ms (p95)
   - Traffic: System handles 1000 req/sec
   - Errors: Error rate <0.1%
   - Saturation: CPU/memory/disk <80%

2. Incident Detection (Real-world timing):
   - Health check detects failure within 30 seconds
   - Alert fires within 60 seconds
   - System auto-recovers within 5 minutes

3. Service Dependency Scenarios:
   - AI DAWG Backend down â JARVIS marks as "degraded"
   - All services down â JARVIS marks as "down"
   - Partial outage â JARVIS isolates failed service (circuit breaker)

4. Edge Cases from Real Incidents:
   - Service returns 200 OK but payload is empty
   - Health check times out (>5 seconds)
   - Cascading failures (one service takes down others)
   - Network partition (can't reach service but it's healthy)

STEPS:
1. Read /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/core/health-aggregator.ts
2. Identify all exported functions and classes
3. Generate tests using Jest/Vitest covering:
   - Happy path (all services healthy)
   - Each of the Four Golden Signals failing
   - Real-world timing requirements
   - Edge cases discovered from production incidents
4. Write tests to /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/unit/health-aggregator.test.ts
5. Execute: cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis && npm test
6. Report: Number of tests written, coverage %, pass/fail count

TARGET: 80%+ code coverage with real-world scenarios

RETURN FORMAT:
Provide a summary with:
- Tests written: [number]
- Coverage: [percentage]
- Test results: [X passed, Y failed]
- Real-world scenarios validated: [list]
- Issues discovered: [if any]`,

  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
)
```

#### What the Agent Does (Autonomously)
```typescript
// Agent spawned by Claude Code (separate context)

Step 1: Read the file
[Uses Read tool]
Read(/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/core/health-aggregator.ts)

// Agent sees:
export class HealthAggregator {
  async checkAll(): Promise<HealthStatus> { ... }
  async checkAIDawgBackend(): Promise<ServiceHealth> { ... }
  async checkVocalCoach(): Promise<ServiceHealth> { ... }
  // ... etc
}

Step 2: Generate tests
[Uses Write tool]
Write(/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/unit/health-aggregator.test.ts, `
import { HealthAggregator } from '../../src/core/health-aggregator';

describe('HealthAggregator - Real-World Scenarios', () => {
  describe('Four Golden Signals', () => {
    it('should detect latency >100ms (p95) as degraded', async () => {
      const aggregator = new HealthAggregator();
      // Mock service with 150ms response time
      const result = await aggregator.checkAIDawgBackend();
      expect(result.status).toBe('degraded');
      expect(result.metrics.latencyP95).toBeGreaterThan(100);
    });

    it('should detect error rate >0.1% as unhealthy', async () => {
      // Test error rate threshold
    });

    it('should detect saturation >80% as degraded', async () => {
      // Test CPU/memory/disk saturation
    });
  });

  describe('Incident Detection Timing', () => {
    it('should detect failure within 30 seconds', async () => {
      // Mock service going down
      const start = Date.now();
      await aggregator.checkAll();
      const elapsed = Date.now() - start;
      expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(30000);
    });
  });

  describe('Service Dependencies', () => {
    it('should mark as degraded when Backend down', async () => {
      // Mock AI DAWG Backend returning 500
      const result = await aggregator.checkAll();
      expect(result.overall).toBe('degraded');
      expect(result.services.aiDawgBackend).toBe('down');
    });
  });

  describe('Edge Cases from Production', () => {
    it('should handle 200 OK with empty payload', async () => {
      // Service returns 200 but body is {}
      const result = await aggregator.checkAIDawgBackend();
      expect(result.status).toBe('degraded');
      expect(result.error).toContain('empty response');
    });

    it('should timeout health check after 5 seconds', async () => {
      // Service takes 10 seconds to respond
      const result = await aggregator.checkVocalCoach();
      expect(result.status).toBe('down');
      expect(result.error).toContain('timeout');
    });
  });
});
`)

Step 3: Execute tests
[Uses Bash tool]
Bash: cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis && npm test -- health-aggregator.test.ts

// Output:
PASS  tests/unit/health-aggregator.test.ts
  HealthAggregator - Real-World Scenarios
    Four Golden Signals
      â should detect latency >100ms (p95) as degraded (45ms)
      â should detect error rate >0.1% as unhealthy (12ms)
      â should detect saturation >80% as degraded (8ms)
    Incident Detection Timing
      â should detect failure within 30 seconds (142ms)
    Service Dependencies
      â should mark as degraded when Backend down (23ms)
    Edge Cases from Production
      â should handle 200 OK with empty payload (34ms)
      â should timeout health check after 5 seconds (5012ms)

Tests:       7 passed, 7 total
Coverage:    87.3% (target: 80%+)

Step 4: Return report to Instance 8
[Agent's final response]

## Unit Test Generation Complete

**Tests written**: 7 tests
**Coverage**: 87.3% â (exceeded target of 80%)
**Test results**: 7 passed, 0 failed â

**Real-world scenarios validated**:
1. â Four Golden Signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
2. â Incident detection within 30 seconds
3. â Service dependency handling (degraded state)
4. â Edge cases: Empty payload, timeout handling

**Issues discovered**: None - all tests passing

The health aggregator correctly implements DevOps best practices for production monitoring.
```

#### Instance 8 Receives Report
```typescript
// Back in Instance 8's context (terminal 1)

â Unit test agent completed!

Report:
- 7 tests generated
- 87.3% coverage (exceeded 80% target)
- All tests passing
- Real-world DevOps scenarios validated

Moving on to next agent: Security Scanner...
```

### 3.3 Parallel Agent Spawning

Instance 8 can spawn **multiple agents simultaneously** for faster testing:

```typescript
// Instance 8 spawns 5 agents in PARALLEL (one API call)

[Instance 8 sends ONE message with FIVE Task tool calls]

Task(description: "Generate unit tests", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "general-purpose")
Task(description: "Security scan", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "general-purpose")
Task(description: "Explore edge cases", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "general-purpose")
Task(description: "Integration tests", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "general-purpose")
Task(description: "Performance tests", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "general-purpose")

// All 5 agents work simultaneously
// Instance 8 receives 5 reports back
// Total time: Max(agent times) instead of Sum(agent times)
```

**Timing comparison**:
- Sequential: 5 agents Ã 10 minutes each = 50 minutes
- Parallel: Max(10 min) = 10 minutes â¡

```
You are a security expert testing a production DevOps system.

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT (2025 Security):
- 45% of breaches exfiltrate data in <1 day
- Common attack vectors: SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass, privilege escalation
- Modern defenses: WAF, rate limiting, JWT with short expiry, RBAC

TEST THESE ATTACK SCENARIOS:

1. Authentication Bypass Attempts:
   - Missing JWT token â 401 Unauthorized
   - Expired JWT token â 401 with refresh prompt
   - Tampered JWT signature â 401 Forbidden
   - SQL injection in login form â Escaped/parameterized query

2. Authorization Escalation:
   - Regular user accessing admin endpoint â 403 Forbidden
   - User modifying another user's project â 403 Forbidden
   - IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) â UUID instead of incremental IDs

3. Input Validation:
   - XSS in project name: `<script>alert('xss')</script>` â Sanitized
   - SQL injection in search: `'; DROP TABLE users; --` â Parameterized query
   - Path traversal: `../../etc/passwd` â Blocked
   - Oversized payload: 10MB JSON â 413 Payload Too Large

4. Rate Limiting:
   - 100 requests in 1 minute â 429 Too Many Requests
   - Distributed attack from multiple IPs â WAF detection

5. Data Exposure:
   - Password returned in API response â Never include sensitive fields
   - Stack trace in error â Production mode hides stack traces
   - API keys in logs â Redacted with ***

STEPS:
1. Scan all API endpoints in /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/core/gateway.ts
2. Try to exploit each vulnerability
3. Document findings with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. Write security tests to /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/security/
5. Report: Vulnerabilities found, severity, suggested fixes

TARGET: 0 critical/high vulnerabilities
```

### Agent 3: Edge Case Explorer (UPDATED - Music Production)
Use Task tool with prompt:
```
You are a creative QA engineer for a professional DAW (Pro Tools competitor).

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT (Pro Tools Workflows):
- Sessions use 24-bit/48kHz, handle 100+ tracks
- Recording requires <10ms latency (professional standard)
- Editing includes comping, timing correction, pitch correction (Â±15 cents tolerance)
- Mixing takes 1 day to 1 week with automation
- Collaboration: Real-time cloud editing with conflict resolution

EXPLORE THESE EDGE CASES:

1. Recording Scenarios (Real Studio Situations):
   - Artist starts recording before clicking record â Buffer should capture pre-roll
   - Microphone unplugged mid-recording â Save buffer, show error, allow recovery
   - Disk full during 3-hour session â Warn at 90% full, auto-save to alternate location
   - Latency >10ms â Visual warning, suggest buffer size adjustment
   - 100 takes in playlist â Performance should not degrade

2. Collaboration Race Conditions:
   - Two users edit same clip simultaneously â Last write wins, notify both users
   - User A deletes track while User B is editing it â Undo available, track restored
   - Network drops mid-edit â Queue local changes, sync when reconnected
   - Conflicting automation (User A fades in, User B fades out) â Show conflict resolution UI

3. Resource Limits (Professional Sessions):
   - Load 100 tracks with 10 plugins each â Should handle without crashing
   - 4-hour continuous session â Memory should not leak
   - 10GB project folder â Load time <30 seconds, progress indicator
   - Export 100 stems simultaneously â Queue exports, show progress

4. Audio Processing Edge Cases:
   - Pitch correction on silent clip â No-op, no error
   - Time stretch by 400% â Should work but warn about quality degradation
   - Fade applied to 1-sample clip â Handle gracefully
   - Normalize audio that's already at max â Detect and skip

5. File Format Compatibility (Industry Standards):
   - Import Pro Tools AAF session â Preserve track layout, automation
   - Export stems as WAV 24-bit â Verify bit depth and sample rate
   - Load corrupted MP3 â Show error, offer to skip/repair
   - Unicode filename: "é¡¹ç® ðµ.ptx" â Handle correctly on all OS

STEPS:
1. Test project creation, recording, editing, mixing flows
2. For each edge case, write a test that reproduces it
3. Execute tests and document failures (those are bugs!)
4. Write tests to /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/edge-cases/
5. Report: Scenarios tested, bugs found, severity

TARGET: Test 50+ edge cases, find and document all bugs
```

## Part 7: Autonomous Operations Workflows (JARVIS Zero-Touch)

### 7.1 Overview of Autonomous System

Jarvis is designed to operate AI DAWG autonomously for 7+ days without human intervention. This requires testing workflows that validate zero-touch operations, not manual DevOps responses.

**Key Difference**:
- **Manual DevOps** (Parts 1-6): Human engineer responds to alerts
- **Autonomous Jarvis** (Part 7): System responds automatically, no human

### 7.2 Autonomous Control Loop (30-Second Cycle)

```yaml
Control Loop Workflow (Runs every 30 seconds):
  Step 1: Health Check (0-5s)
    - Poll all AI DAWG services
    - Check Four Golden Signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
    - Verify service state matches expected state

  Step 2: Decision Making (5-7s)
    - Analyze health check results
    - Compare against historical patterns (learning system)
    - Determine if action needed

  Step 3: Action Execution (7-10s)
    - If unhealthy: Trigger auto-recovery
    - If healthy: Log state, update metrics
    - If pattern detected: Apply optimization

  Step 4: Logging & Learning (10s)
    - Append event to SQLite database
    - Update performance trends
    - Record for pattern analysis

  Total Duration: <10 seconds (allows 20s buffer before next cycle)
```

**Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
describe('Autonomous Control Loop', () => {
  it('should execute every 30 seconds (Â±2s tolerance)', async () => {
    const iterations = [];
    const duration = 60000; // 60 seconds
    const startTime = Date.now();

    while (Date.now() - startTime < duration) {
      iterations.push(Date.now());
      await sleep(30000);
    }

    // Should have 2 iterations in 60 seconds
    expect(iterations.length).toBe(2);

    // Interval should be 30s Â±2s
    const interval = iterations[1] - iterations[0];
    expect(interval).toBeGreaterThan(28000);
    expect(interval).toBeLessThan(32000);
  });

  it('should complete each iteration in <10 seconds', async () => {
    const start = Date.now();
    await controlLoop.executeIteration();
    const elapsed = Date.now() - start;

    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(10000);
  });
});
```

### 7.3 Auto-Recovery with Retry Limits

```yaml
Auto-Recovery Workflow (No human intervention):
  Detection:
    - Control loop detects service down
    - Logs event to audit trail
    - Increments retry counter

  Attempt 1 (within 30 seconds):
    - Execute: docker-compose restart ai-dawg-backend
    - Wait: 10 seconds for service to start
    - Verify: Health check returns 200 OK
    - Result: [Success â Reset counter] or [Failure â Continue]

  Attempt 2 (if Attempt 1 failed):
    - Execute: kill process + fresh start
    - Wait: 10 seconds
    - Verify: Health check returns 200 OK
    - Result: [Success â Reset counter] or [Failure â Continue]

  Attempt 3 (if Attempt 2 failed):
    - Execute: Full service restart with cache clear
    - Wait: 10 seconds
    - Verify: Health check returns 200 OK
    - Result: [Success â Reset counter] or [Failure â Escalate]

  After 3 Failures:
    - Trigger human escalation
    - Send alert (email/Slack/PagerDuty)
    - Mark service as "requires manual intervention"
    - Continue monitoring other services
    - Do NOT attempt further restarts (prevent infinite loop)
```

**Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
describe('Auto-Recovery with Retry Limits', () => {
  it('should retry max 3 times before human escalation', async () => {
    // Simulate service that always fails to start
    mockService.alwaysFailHealthCheck();

    const result = await autoRecovery.attemptRecovery('ai-dawg-backend');

    expect(result.attempts).toBe(3);
    expect(result.humanEscalationTriggered).toBe(true);
    expect(result.alertSent).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should reset retry counter after successful recovery', async () => {
    // First failure â Recovery succeeds
    mockService.failOnce().thenSucceed();

    await autoRecovery.attemptRecovery('ai-dawg-backend');

    expect(autoRecovery.getRetryCount('ai-dawg-backend')).toBe(0);

    // Second failure should start from attempt 1 again
    mockService.failOnce().thenSucceed();
    await autoRecovery.attemptRecovery('ai-dawg-backend');

    expect(autoRecovery.getRetryCount('ai-dawg-backend')).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

### 7.4 Safety Mechanisms

```yaml
Emergency Kill Switch:
  Variable: JARVIS_AUTONOMOUS=false
  Effect:
    - Control loop stops executing
    - No auto-restarts
    - No auto-deployments
    - All automation paused
    - Manual mode activated

  Test: Set ENV variable â Verify all automation stops

Command Whitelist:
  Allowed Commands:
    - docker-compose restart <service>
    - npm test
    - git pull origin main
    - git checkout <branch>

  Blocked Commands:
    - rm -rf /
    - sudo commands
    - git push (only pull allowed)
    - database DROP statements

  Enforcement: Pre-execution validation, abort if not whitelisted

Rollback on Failure:
  Deployment Steps:
    1. Git checkout <new-version>
    2. Run tests â If fail: Git checkout <previous-version>
    3. Restart services â If fail: Git checkout <previous-version>
    4. Health check â If fail: Git checkout <previous-version>

  Automatic rollback occurs without human approval

Audit Log Immutability:
  Format: Append-only file at /data/audit.log
  Rotation: Daily (audit-YYYY-MM-DD.log)
  Protection:
    - File permissions: 444 (read-only)
    - No delete operation allowed
    - Tampering detection via checksums
```

**Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
describe('Safety Mechanisms', () => {
  it('should stop all automation when kill switch activated', async () => {
    process.env.JARVIS_AUTONOMOUS = 'false';

    await controlLoop.start();

    expect(controlLoop.isRunning()).toBe(false);
    expect(autoRecovery.isEnabled()).toBe(false);
    expect(deployment.isEnabled()).toBe(false);
  });

  it('should block non-whitelisted commands', async () => {
    const dangerousCommand = 'rm -rf /';

    await expect(
      commandExecutor.execute(dangerousCommand)
    ).rejects.toThrow('Command not in whitelist');
  });

  it('should rollback on deployment failure', async () => {
    const currentVersion = await git.getCurrentCommit();

    // Deploy version that fails tests
    mockGit.latestCommit = 'bad-version';
    await deployment.deploy();

    // Should rollback to current version
    const rolledBackVersion = await git.getCurrentCommit();
    expect(rolledBackVersion).toBe(currentVersion);
  });
});
```

### 7.5 Learning & Memory System

```yaml
Event Storage:
  Database: SQLite at /data/events.db
  Schema:
    - timestamp: INTEGER (Unix timestamp)
    - event_type: TEXT (health_check, recovery, deployment, etc.)
    - service: TEXT (ai-dawg-backend, vocal-coach, etc.)
    - status: TEXT (success, failure, degraded)
    - metadata: JSON (details, metrics, context)

  Retention: 90 days, then archive

Pattern Recognition:
  Example Pattern: Service X fails daily at 3am
  Detection:
    - Query events: SELECT * WHERE service='X' AND status='failure'
    - Group by hour: Identify 3am cluster
    - Confidence: 5+ occurrences = pattern

  Action: Schedule preventive restart at 2:55am

Performance Optimization:
  Example: Endpoint /api/projects is slow (>500ms)
  Detection:
    - Track latency metrics
    - Identify trend: Getting slower over time

  Learning: Apply caching, reduce query complexity
  Validation: Measure improvement, roll back if worse

Query Performance:
  Requirement: Retrieve insights from 1M+ events in <1 second
  Optimization:
    - Index on timestamp, service, event_type
    - Limit queries to recent 30 days by default
    - Use aggregation (COUNT, AVG) instead of row-by-row
```

**Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
describe('Learning & Memory System', () => {
  it('should store 1000 events in SQLite', async () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      await eventStore.record({
        event_type: 'health_check',
        service: 'ai-dawg-backend',
        status: 'success',
        metadata: { latency: 50 + Math.random() * 100 }
      });
    }

    const count = await eventStore.count();
    expect(count).toBe(1000);
  });

  it('should detect failure pattern (service fails at same time daily)', async () => {
    // Create pattern: Service fails at 3am for 7 days
    for (let day = 0; day < 7; day++) {
      await eventStore.record({
        timestamp: getTimestampFor3AM(day),
        event_type: 'health_check',
        service: 'ai-dawg-backend',
        status: 'failure'
      });
    }

    const patterns = await patternAnalyzer.analyze();

    expect(patterns).toContainEqual({
      service: 'ai-dawg-backend',
      pattern: 'daily_failure_at_3am',
      confidence: 'high'
    });
  });
});
```

### 7.6 Autonomous Deployment

```yaml
Git Update Detection:
  Polling: Every 5 minutes (git fetch origin main)
  Detection: Compare local HEAD with origin/main
  Trigger: If behind, initiate deployment

Staging Deployment:
  Environment: staging (separate Docker containers)
  Steps:
    1. Git checkout origin/main
    2. Docker-compose up -d (staging)
    3. Wait 30s for services to start
    4. Run test suite: npm test
    5. Run health checks
    6. Run smoke tests (critical endpoints)

  Decision:
    - All tests pass â Proceed to production
    - Any test fails â Abort, rollback staging, alert human

Production Deployment:
  Steps:
    1. Take snapshot of current state (git commit hash, config)
    2. Git checkout origin/main (production)
    3. Docker-compose up -d --no-deps <service>
    4. Wait 30s
    5. Health check all services
    6. Run smoke tests

  Rollback Triggers:
    - Health check fails
    - Smoke test fails
    - Error rate >1% within 5 minutes
    - Latency >2x baseline

  Rollback Action:
    - Git checkout <previous-commit>
    - Docker-compose up -d
    - Wait 30s
    - Verify health
    - Alert human of rollback

Post-Deploy Validation (30 minutes):
  Monitor:
    - Error rate (target: <0.1%)
    - Latency (target: <100ms p95)
    - CPU/memory (target: <80% usage)
    - User traffic (compare to baseline)

  If metrics degraded: Automatic rollback
  If metrics stable: Mark deployment successful
```

**Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
describe('Autonomous Deployment', () => {
  it('should detect git updates and trigger deployment', async () => {
    // Simulate new commit on origin/main
    mockGit.pushCommit('origin/main', 'feat: new feature');

    // Wait for polling cycle (5 min)
    await sleep(300000);

    expect(deployment.isInProgress()).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should rollback on deployment failure', async () => {
    const currentCommit = await git.getCurrentCommit();

    // Deploy commit that fails health checks
    mockGit.pushCommit('origin/main', 'bad-commit');
    await deployment.deploy();

    // Should auto-rollback
    const finalCommit = await git.getCurrentCommit();
    expect(finalCommit).toBe(currentCommit);
    expect(deployment.getLastStatus()).toBe('rolled_back');
  });
});
```

### 7.7 Long-Running Stability (7-Day Target)

```yaml
7-Day Autonomous Operation Requirements:
  Memory Usage:
    - Initial: ~500MB
    - Target after 7 days: <2GB
    - No memory leaks (gradual growth indicates leak)

  SQLite Database:
    - Events generated: ~20,160 (2,880 per day * 7 days)
    - Database size: <500MB
    - Query performance: <1s for any query

  Service Health:
    - All services: 99.9% uptime (43 min downtime allowed per 7 days)
    - Auto-recovery success rate: >95%
    - Human escalations: <10 per 7 days

  CPU Usage:
    - Average: <20%
    - Peak: <50%
    - Sustained high CPU (>80%) indicates issue

  System Stability:
    - No crashes
    - No infinite loops
    - No deadlocks
    - Graceful degradation on resource constraints

Monitoring Metrics:
  Every 30 seconds:
    - Record: Memory usage, CPU%, disk space, SQLite size
    - Store: In metrics.json
    - Alert: If any threshold exceeded

  Daily Summary:
    - Uptime: 99.9%+
    - Events processed: 2,880
    - Auto-recoveries: X
    - Human escalations: X
    - Average latency: <100ms
```

**Test Scenarios (Simulated)**:
```typescript
describe('Long-Running Stability (7-Day Simulation)', () => {
  it('should run for simulated 7 days without memory leaks', async () => {
    const initialMemory = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;

    // Simulate 7 days (20,160 iterations) in fast-forward
    for (let i = 0; i < 20160; i++) {
      await controlLoop.executeIteration();

      // Sample memory every 1000 iterations
      if (i % 1000 === 0) {
        const currentMemory = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;
        const growth = currentMemory - initialMemory;

        // Memory should not grow beyond 2GB
        expect(growth).toBeLessThan(2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
      }
    }

    // Final memory check
    const finalMemory = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;
    expect(finalMemory).toBeLessThan(2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024);
  });

  it('should maintain SQLite performance with 1M+ events', async () => {
    // Insert 1M events
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
      await eventStore.record({ /* event data */ });
    }

    // Query should complete in <1s
    const start = Date.now();
    const insights = await patternAnalyzer.getInsights();
    const elapsed = Date.now() - start;

    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(1000);
  });
});
```

## Part 8: Cloud Infrastructure Workflows (JARVIS Cloud-First Migration)

### 8.1 Overview - Cloud-First Full Autonomy

**Context**: Week 2-6 of 6-week cloud migration plan where Jarvis moves from local operations to AWS ECS/GCP Cloud Run with full business automation.

**Key Difference from Local Operations**:
- **Local (Week 1)**: Services run on local machine, manual monitoring
- **Cloud (Week 2+)**: Services run on AWS/GCP, autonomous scaling and cost optimization

**Cloud Architecture**:
```yaml
AWS/GCP Cloud:
  Jarvis Control Plane:
    - Deployment: AWS ECS Fargate OR Google Cloud Run
    - Auto-scaling: 2-5 ECS tasks OR 1-10 Cloud Run instances
    - Database: PostgreSQL RDS (Multi-AZ)
    - Cache: ElastiCache Redis
    - Storage: S3 for logs and configurations

  AI DAWG Services:
    - Deployment: Kubernetes (GKE)
    - Pods: Producer (8001), Vocal Coach (8000), AI Brain (8003)
    - Auto-scaling: HPA (3-10 pods per service)
    - Storage: S3 for audio files

  Business Intelligence:
    - Cost tracking: CloudWatch + Billing API
    - Model routing: Claude/GPT-4o/Gemini based on cost
    - Customer lifecycle: Stripe + email automation
```

### 8.2 AWS ECS Deployment Workflow

#### ECS Service Creation (5 minutes)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Build Docker image
     - Package Jarvis with all dependencies
     - Tag: jarvis:v1.0.0
     - Push to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

  2. Create ECS Task Definition
     - CPU: 512 (0.5 vCPU)
     - Memory: 1024MB
     - Environment: POSTGRES_HOST, REDIS_HOST, AWS_REGION
     - Health check: GET /health every 30s

  3. Create ECS Service
     - Fargate launch type (serverless)
     - Desired count: 2 tasks
     - Load balancer: Application Load Balancer
     - Target group health check: /health

  4. Verify deployment
     - All 2 tasks: RUNNING status
     - Health check: HEALTHY
     - Load balancer: IN_SERVICE

Real-world timing:
  - Image build: 2 minutes
  - ECR push: 1 minute
  - ECS deploy: 2 minutes
  - Total: <5 minutes
```

#### Test Scenario - ECS Deployment:
```typescript
describe('AWS ECS Deployment', () => {
  it('should deploy Jarvis to ECS within 5 minutes', async () => {
    const startTime = Date.now();

    // Build and push image
    await docker.build('jarvis:v1.0.0');
    await ecr.push('jarvis:v1.0.0');

    // Deploy to ECS
    const deployment = await ecs.deployService({
      serviceName: 'jarvis-control-plane',
      image: 'ecr.../jarvis:v1.0.0',
      cpu: 512,
      memory: 1024,
      desiredCount: 2
    });

    // Verify
    expect(deployment.status).toBe('ACTIVE');
    expect(deployment.runningCount).toBe(2);
    expect(deployment.healthCheck).toBe('HEALTHY');

    const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(300000); // 5 minutes
  });
});
```

#### ECS Auto-Scaling Workflow (3 minutes)
```yaml
Scenario: Traffic spike from 100 req/sec to 1000 req/sec

Workflow:
  1. CloudWatch alarm triggers (CPU >80%)
  2. ECS auto-scaling policy activates
  3. ECS scales from 2 to 5 tasks
  4. Load balancer distributes traffic to new tasks
  5. CloudWatch alarm clears (CPU <80%)

Real-world timing:
  - Alarm trigger: <30 seconds
  - Task provisioning: 1-2 minutes
  - Health check: 30 seconds
  - Total scale-up: <3 minutes
```

#### Test Scenario - ECS Auto-Scaling:
```typescript
describe('ECS Auto-Scaling', () => {
  it('should scale from 2 to 5 tasks on high CPU', async () => {
    // Simulate high traffic
    await loadTest.generate({ requestsPerSecond: 1000 });

    // Wait for scaling
    await sleep(180000); // 3 minutes

    // Verify scaling
    const taskCount = await ecs.getRunningTasks('jarvis-control-plane');
    expect(taskCount).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(4);
    expect(taskCount).toBeLessThanOrEqual(5);

    // Verify latency maintained
    const metrics = await cloudwatch.getLatencyMetrics();
    expect(metrics.p95).toBeLessThan(100); // Still <100ms
  });
});
```

      maxInstances: 10
    });

    // Verify
    expect(deployment.url).toBeDefined();
    const health = await fetch(`${deployment.url}/health`);
    expect(health.status).toBe(200);

    const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(180000); // 3 minutes
  });

  it('should have cold start <5 seconds', async () => {
    // Scale to 0 instances
    await cloudRun.scaleToZero('jarvis');
    await sleep(60000); // Wait 1 minute

    // Trigger cold start
    const startTime = Date.now();
    await fetch(`${serviceUrl}/health`);
    const coldStart = Date.now() - startTime;

    expect(coldStart).toBeLessThan(5000); // <5 seconds
  });
});
```

### 8.4 Kubernetes Deployment Workflow (AI DAWG)

#### Deploy Pods to GKE (5 minutes)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Create Kubernetes Deployment manifests
     - ai-producer-deployment.yaml
     - vocal-coach-deployment.yaml
     - ai-brain-deployment.yaml

  2. Deploy to GKE
     - kubectl apply -f deployments/
     - Replicas: 3 per service

    await kubectl.waitForPods({
      selector: 'app=ai-producer',
      count: 3
    });
    const recoveryTime = Date.now() - startTime;

    expect(recoveryTime).toBeLessThan(10000); // <10 seconds
  });
});
```

### 8.5 Cloud Infrastructure Workflows

#### PostgreSQL RDS Migration (10 minutes)
```yaml
Workflow:
  1. Create RDS instance
     - Instance class: db.t3.micro
     - PostgreSQL 14
     - Storage: 20GB gp3
     - Multi-AZ: false (dev/test)

  2. Migrate from local SQLite
     - Read all events from events.db
     - Batch insert (1000 events per batch)
     - Total: 10,000 events

  3. Update connection strings
     - POSTGRES_HOST=rds-endpoint.region.rds.amazonaws.com
     - POSTGRES_USER=jarvis_app
     - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<from Secrets Manager>

Real-world timing:
  - RDS creation: 8 minutes
  - Data migration: 2 minutes (10,000 events)
  - Total: <10 minutes
```

#### Test Scenario - RDS Migration:
```typescript
describe('PostgreSQL RDS Migration', () => {
  it('should migrate 10,000 events from SQLite within 2 minutes', async () => {
    // Read from SQLite
    const events = await sqlite.query('SELECT * FROM events');
    expect(events.length).toBe(10000);

    const startTime = Date.now();

    // Migrate to RDS (batch insert)
    for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i += 1000) {
      const batch = events.slice(i, i + 1000);
      await postgres.insertBatch('events', batch);
    }

    const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(120000); // 2 minutes

    // Verify count
    const rdsCount = await postgres.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events');
    expect(rdsCount).toBe(10000);
  });

  it('should failover to standby within 2 minutes (Multi-AZ)', async () => {

    await rds.modifyInstance({ multiAZ: true });

    // Simulate primary failure
    await rds.simulateFailure('primary');
    const startTime = Date.now();

    // Wait for failover
    let connected = false;
    while (!connected && Date.now() - startTime < 120000) {

    const failoverTime = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(failoverTime).toBeLessThan(120000); // <2 minutes
    expect(connected).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### 8.6 Multi-Cloud Communication Workflow

#### ECS â GKE Cross-Cloud Request
```yaml
Scenario: Jarvis (ECS) sends request to AI DAWG (GKE)

Workflow:
  1. Jarvis receives user request: "Generate trap beat at 140 BPM"
  2. Jarvis routes to AI Producer on GKE
  3. Request travels: ECS (us-east-1) â GKE (us-central1)
  4. AI Producer generates beat (10-30s)
  5. Response returns to Jarvis
  6. Jarvis logs event to PostgreSQL RDS

Real-world timing:
  - Cross-cloud latency: 50-100ms
  - AI generation: 10-30 seconds
  - Total request: 10-30 seconds
```

#### Test Scenario - Multi-Cloud Communication:
```typescript
describe('Multi-Cloud Communication', () => {
  it('should maintain <100ms latency ECS â GKE', async () => {
    const latencies = [];

    // Measure 100 requests
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      const start = Date.now();
      await fetch('http://gke-load-balancer/api/health');
      latencies.push(Date.now() - start);
    }

    const p95 = latencies.sort((a, b) => a - b)[94];
    expect(p95).toBeLessThan(100); // <100ms p95
  });

  it('should complete full AI request within 30 seconds', async () => {
    const startTime = Date.now();

    const response = await fetch('http://jarvis-alb/api/generate-beat', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ genre: 'trap', bpm: 140 })
    });

    const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(30000); // <30 seconds
  });
});
```

### 8.7 Business Automation Workflows (Week 3+)

#### Autonomous Cost Optimization
```yaml
Scenario: Monthly cost reaches 90% of $500 budget

Workflow:
  1. Cost tracker detects $450 spent (90% of budget)
  2. Jarvis analyzes model usage:
     - GPT-4o: $300 (60% of cost)
     - Gemini: $100 (20% of cost)
     - Claude: $50 (10% of cost)

  3. Jarvis decides: Switch 50% of GPT-4o traffic to Gemini
     - Projected savings: $75/month
     - New projection: $375/month (within budget)

  4. Jarvis applies change:
     - Update model router configuration
     - Deploy to ECS (rolling update)
     - Monitor for 1 hour

  5. Jarvis validates:
     - Cost projection updated: $375/month
     - Quality maintained (user satisfaction >90%)
     - Alert sent: "Autonomous cost optimization applied"

Real-world timing:
  - Detection: Real-time (budget tracking)
  - Analysis: 30 seconds
  - Decision: 10 seconds
  - Deployment: 2 minutes
  - Total: <3 minutes
```

#### Test Scenario - Autonomous Cost Optimization:

describe('Autonomous Cost Optimization', () => {
  it('should switch models when budget threshold reached', async () => {
    // Set budget
    await businessIntelligence.setBudget(500);

    // Simulate $450 spent
    await costTracker.recordCosts([
      { model: 'gpt-4o', cost: 300 },
      { model: 'gemini', cost: 100 },
      { model: 'claude', cost: 50 }
    ]);

    // Verify decision
    expect(decision.action).toBe('switch_model');
    expect(decision.from).toBe('gpt-4o');
    expect(decision.to).toBe('gemini');
    expect(decision.percentage).toBe(50);
    expect(decision.projectedSavings).toBeGreaterThan(70);

    // Verify deployment
    const config = await modelRouter.getConfig();
    expect(config.gpt4o.weight).toBe(50); // Reduced from 100
    expect(config.gemini.weight).toBe(50); // Increased from 0
  });

  it('should scale down ECS tasks during low traffic', async () => {
    // Simulate low traffic (3am, 10 req/min)
    await trafficSimulator.generate({
      requestsPerMinute: 10,
      hour: 3
    });

    // Wait for scaling decision
    await sleep(300000); // 5 minutes

    // Verify scaling
    const taskCount = await ecs.getRunningTasks('jarvis-control-plane');
    expect(taskCount).toBe(1); // Scaled from 2 to 1

    // Verify cost savings
    const savings = await costTracker.getHourlySavings();
    expect(savings).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

#### Customer Lifecycle Automation
```yaml
Scenario 1: New user signup

Workflow:
  1. User signs up via web form
  2. Jarvis autonomous actions:
     - Create Stripe customer
     - Generate API key
     - Send welcome email
     - Provision dashboard access
     - Create PostgreSQL user record
  3. User receives email with login link
  4. All actions logged to audit trail

Real-world timing:
  - Stripe API: 500ms
  - Email send: 1 second
  - PostgreSQL insert: 100ms
  - Total: <2 seconds

Scenario 2: Churn detection

Workflow:
  1. Jarvis detects: User inactive for 30 days
  2. Jarvis calculates churn risk: HIGH (90%)
  3. Jarvis autonomous actions:
     - Send re-engagement email
     - Offer 20% discount (next month)
     - Flag account for manual review
  4. If user returns: Churn risk lowered
  5. If user doesn't return after 60 days: Account deactivated

Real-world timing:
  - Daily churn check: Runs at midnight
  - Email send: <2 seconds
  - Total: Batch process (all users checked daily)
```

#### Test Scenario - Customer Lifecycle:
```typescript
describe('Customer Lifecycle Automation', () => {
  it('should auto-onboard new customer', async () => {
    const user = {
      email: 'test@example.com',
      plan: 'pro'
    };

    const startTime = Date.now();

    // Trigger signup
    const result = await customerLifecycle.onboard(user);

    const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;

    // Verify actions completed
    expect(result.stripeCustomerId).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.apiKey).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.welcomeEmailSent).toBe(true);
    expect(result.dashboardProvisioned).toBe(true);

    // Verify timing
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(2000); // <2 seconds

    // Verify user in database
    const dbUser = await postgres.query(
      'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1',
      [user.email]
    );
    expect(dbUser).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should detect churn and re-engage', async () => {
    // Create user with 30 days inactivity
    const user = await createUser({
      email: 'inactive@example.com',
      lastActive: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 86400000) // 30 days ago
    });

    // Run churn detection
    const result = await churnDetection.check(user);

    // Verify churn detected
    expect(result.churnRisk).toBe('high');
    expect(result.riskScore).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);

    // Verify re-engagement actions
    expect(result.reEngagementEmailSent).toBe(true);
    expect(result.discountOffered).toBe(true);
    expect(result.discountPercentage).toBe(20);

    // Verify audit log
    const auditLog = await postgres.query(
      'SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE user_id = $1',
      [user.id]
    );
    expect(auditLog.some(l => l.action === 'churn_detected')).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Next Step
Update `.claude/prompts/instance-8-test-orchestrator.md` with the new prompts from Part 4.1, then run:

```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis
claude
cat .claude/prompts/instance-8-test-orchestrator.md
```

Instance 8 will now spawn agents that validate real-world user behavior! ð
