2. Read real-world workflows: `Read /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/REAL_WORLD_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION.md`
3. Analyze codebase: `Grep -r "export.*function" /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src`
4. Identify gaps in test coverage
5. Create test plan in `.claude/test-plans/master-plan.json`

### Phase 2: Spawn Test Agents (Parallel)
Use the Task tool to spawn 7 specialized agents IN PARALLEL (single message with 7 Task calls):

#### Agent 1: Unit Test Generator (DevOps Focus)
```
Task tool with prompt:
"You are a unit testing expert for DevOps monitoring and music production systems.

SYSTEM: JARVIS Control Plane
FILE: /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/core/health-aggregator.ts

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT (2025 DevOps):
- Production incidents must be detected in <30 seconds
- Teams monitor Four Golden Signals: latency (<100ms p95), traffic (1000 req/sec), errors (<0.1%), saturation (<80%)
- Automated recovery happens in 1-5 minutes (restart pods, scale resources)
- SLOs: 99.9% uptime (43 min downtime/month allowed)

SCENARIOS TO TEST:
1. Four Golden Signals Monitoring:
   - ✅ All services healthy: latency <100ms, error rate <0.1%, saturation <80%
   - ⚠️ Latency degraded: p95 response time 150ms (threshold: 100ms)
   - ⚠️ Traffic spike: 2000 req/sec (capacity: 1000 req/sec)
   - ❌ Error rate critical: 5% errors (threshold: 0.1%)
   - ❌ Saturation critical: 95% CPU usage (threshold: 80%)

2. Incident Detection Timing (Real-world SLAs):
   - Health check runs every 30 seconds → Test polling interval
   - Alert fires within 60 seconds of failure → Test alert latency
   - Auto-recovery attempts within 5 minutes → Test recovery timing

3. Service Dependencies (Realistic Scenarios):
   - AI DAWG Backend down → Gateway should return 503 with degraded status
   - Vocal Coach timeout (>5s) → Mark as down, continue checking other services
   - Cascading failure → Circuit breaker isolates failing service

4. Edge Cases from Real Production Incidents:
   - 200 OK with empty payload → Detect and mark as degraded
   - Health endpoint times out → Mark as down after 5 seconds
   - Network partition → Can't reach service but it's actually healthy
   - Flapping service → Healthy, down, healthy within 5 minutes (avoid alert spam)

STEPS:
1. Read the file
2. Generate Jest tests covering all scenarios above
3. Write to /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/unit/health-aggregator.test.ts
4. Execute: cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis && npm test
5. Report: Tests written, coverage %, scenarios validated

TARGET: 80%+ coverage, all real-world scenarios tested"

Agent type: general-purpose
```

#### Agent 2: Security Scanner (Real Attack Vectors)
```
Task tool with prompt:
"You are a security expert testing a production DevOps system.

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT (2025 Security):
- 45% of breaches exfiltrate data in <1 day
- Common attack vectors: SQL injection, XSS, auth bypass, privilege escalation
- Modern defenses: WAF, rate limiting, JWT with short expiry, RBAC

TEST THESE ATTACK SCENARIOS:

1. Authentication Bypass Attempts:
   - Missing JWT token → 401 Unauthorized
   - Expired JWT token → 401 with refresh prompt
   - Tampered JWT signature → 401 Forbidden
   - SQL injection in login form → Escaped/parameterized query

2. Authorization Escalation:
   - Regular user accessing admin endpoint → 403 Forbidden
   - User modifying another user's project → 403 Forbidden
   - IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) → UUID instead of incremental IDs

3. Input Validation:
   - XSS in project name: `<script>alert('xss')</script>` → Sanitized
   - SQL injection in search: `'; DROP TABLE users; --` → Parameterized query
   - Path traversal: `../../etc/passwd` → Blocked
   - Oversized payload: 10MB JSON → 413 Payload Too Large

4. Rate Limiting:
   - 100 requests in 1 minute → 429 Too Many Requests
   - Distributed attack from multiple IPs → WAF detection

5. Data Exposure:
   - Password returned in API response → Never include sensitive fields
   - Stack trace in error → Production mode hides stack traces
   - API keys in logs → Redacted with ***

STEPS:
1. Scan all API endpoints in /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/src/core/gateway.ts
2. Try to exploit each vulnerability
3. Document findings with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. Write security tests to /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/security/
5. Report: Vulnerabilities found, severity, suggested fixes

TARGET: 0 critical/high vulnerabilities"

Agent type: general-purpose
```

#### Agent 3: Edge Case Explorer (Music Production Workflows)
```
Task tool with prompt:
"You are a creative QA engineer for a professional DAW (Pro Tools competitor).

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT (Pro Tools Workflows):
- Sessions use 24-bit/48kHz, handle 100+ tracks
- Recording requires <10ms latency (professional standard)
- Editing includes comping, timing correction, pitch correction (±15 cents tolerance)
- Mixing takes 1 day to 1 week with automation
- Collaboration: Real-time cloud editing with conflict resolution

EXPLORE THESE EDGE CASES:

1. Recording Scenarios (Real Studio Situations):
   - Artist starts recording before clicking record → Buffer should capture pre-roll
   - Microphone unplugged mid-recording → Save buffer, show error, allow recovery
   - Disk full during 3-hour session → Warn at 90% full, auto-save to alternate location
   - Latency >10ms → Visual warning, suggest buffer size adjustment
   - 100 takes in playlist → Performance should not degrade

2. Collaboration Race Conditions:
   - Two users edit same clip simultaneously → Last write wins, notify both users
   - User A deletes track while User B is editing it → Undo available, track restored
   - Network drops mid-edit → Queue local changes, sync when reconnected
   - Conflicting automation (User A fades in, User B fades out) → Show conflict resolution UI

3. Resource Limits (Professional Sessions):
   - Load 100 tracks with 10 plugins each → Should handle without crashing
   - 4-hour continuous session → Memory should not leak
   - 10GB project folder → Load time <30 seconds, progress indicator
   - Export 100 stems simultaneously → Queue exports, show progress

4. Audio Processing Edge Cases:
   - Pitch correction on silent clip → No-op, no error
   - Time stretch by 400% → Should work but warn about quality degradation
   - Fade applied to 1-sample clip → Handle gracefully
   - Normalize audio that's already at max → Detect and skip

5. File Format Compatibility (Industry Standards):
   - Import Pro Tools AAF session → Preserve track layout, automation
   - Export stems as WAV 24-bit → Verify bit depth and sample rate
   - Load corrupted MP3 → Show error, offer to skip/repair
   - Unicode filename: \"项目 🎵.ptx\" → Handle correctly on all OS

STEPS:
1. Test project creation, recording, editing, mixing flows in AI DAWG
2. For each edge case, write a test that reproduces it
3. Execute tests and document failures (those are bugs!)
4. Write tests to /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/edge-cases/
