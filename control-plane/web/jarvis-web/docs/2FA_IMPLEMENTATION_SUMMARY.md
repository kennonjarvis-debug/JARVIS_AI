## User Flow Diagrams

### Setup Flow
```
1. User → Settings → Enable 2FA
2. System → Generate TOTP Secret → Display QR Code
3. User → Scan QR → Enter 6-digit code
4. System → Verify Code → Generate Backup Codes
5. System → Display Backup Codes (download/print)
6. User → Confirms saved → 2FA Enabled ✓
```

### Login Flow
```
1. User → Login (Google OAuth)
2. System → Check 2FA enabled?
   ├─ No → Grant access
   └─ Yes → Redirect to 2FA prompt
3. User → Enter TOTP code or backup code
4. System → Validate code + Rate limit check
5. System → Mark session as verified → Grant access ✓
```

### Recovery Flow
```
1. User → Lost authenticator
2. User → Use backup code at login
3. System → Verify + mark code as used
4. User → Access granted → Navigate to settings
5. User → Regenerate backup codes
6. User → Re-enable 2FA with new authenticator (optional)
```

## Recovery Mechanisms

### 1. Backup Codes (Primary)
- 10 codes provided during setup
- Single-use only
- Can be regenerated with authenticator code
- Downloadable as text file
- Printable for physical storage

### 2. Manual Admin Recovery (Last Resort)
- User contacts support with proof of identity
- Admin manually disables 2FA via SQL
- User receives email notification
- User logs in and re-enables 2FA
- Process takes 24-48 hours

### 3. Regeneration Process
- Requires current authenticator code
- Invalidates all old backup codes
- Generates 10 new codes
- Logged in audit trail

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- All queries use indexed fields
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Cascade delete prevents orphaned records
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage

### Caching Opportunities
- User 2FA status (reduce DB lookups)
- Rate limiter state (consider Redis)
- Session verification status

### Optimization Tips
- Use Redis for rate limiting in production
- Consider connection pooling for Prisma
- Monitor slow queries with PostgreSQL logs
- Cache QR codes temporarily during setup

---

## Security Hardening Checklist

✅ **Implemented:**
- TOTP secrets stored securely
- Backup codes bcrypt hashed
- Rate limiting on verification
- Audit logging of all events
- Session-based verification
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error messages don't leak information

🔄 **Recommended Future Enhancements:**
- Encrypt TOTP secrets at rest
- Add device fingerprinting
- Implement trusted device list
- Email notifications for 2FA changes
- SMS fallback (with security caveats)
- Biometric authentication option
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 support

---

## Compliance & Standards

### Standards Compliance
- ✅ RFC 6238 (TOTP)
- ✅ OWASP Authentication Guidelines
- ✅ NIST SP 800-63B (Digital Identity)

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR:** 2FA data included in data exports/deletion
- **SOC 2:** Access controls implemented
- **ISO 27001:** Security controls documented
- **HIPAA:** Additional controls for PHI if applicable

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Recommended Metrics
- 2FA adoption rate (% of users)
- Failed login attempts per day
- Backup code usage frequency
- Rate limit triggers
- Manual 2FA disables by admins

### Alert Thresholds
- >10 failed attempts from single IP (potential attack)
- Multiple users locked out (system issue?)
- Spike in backup code usage (authenticator problems?)
- High rate of 2FA disables (user friction?)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **In-Memory Rate Limiting:**
   - Current implementation uses in-memory storage
   - Won't work across multiple server instances
   - **Solution:** Use Redis for production

2. **No Device Trust:**
   - Users must verify every login
   - No "remember this device" option
   - **Solution:** Implement device fingerprinting

3. **No SMS Fallback:**
   - Only TOTP and backup codes supported
   - Some users may prefer SMS
   - **Solution:** Add SMS provider integration (with security caveats)

4. **Manual Admin Recovery:**
   - Requires support intervention
   - 24-48 hour delay
   - **Solution:** Add self-service email recovery flow

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Run database migration
2. ✅ Test 2FA flow end-to-end
3. ✅ Deploy to staging environment
4. ⬜ Perform security audit

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement Redis-based rate limiting
2. Add device fingerprinting
3. Email notifications for 2FA events
4. WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
5. Biometric authentication
6. SMS fallback option
7. Self-service recovery flow

### Production Deployment
