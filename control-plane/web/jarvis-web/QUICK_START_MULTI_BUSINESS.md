   - Copy the Price ID

   **Product 3: Business Enterprise**

// In your component:

  <BusinessSwitcher currentBusinessSlug={businessSlug} />
</nav>
```

2. Create another business
3. Click the BusinessSwitcher dropdown

6. Stripe webhook will update your business subscription

### Step 6: Test Webhook (Optional)

```

2. Login to Stripe:
```bash

```

3. Forward webhooks to your local server:
