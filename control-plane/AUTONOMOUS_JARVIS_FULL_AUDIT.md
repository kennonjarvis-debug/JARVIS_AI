# AUTONOMOUS JARVIS - COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT & BUSINESS AUTOMATION ROADMAP

**Generated:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** Currently Running - SUGGEST Mode
**Analysis Frequency:** Every 5 minutes
**System Health Monitoring:** Every 30 seconds

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Jarvis is currently running an autonomous AI orchestration system with **7 domain agents** managing various aspects of your AI DAWG infrastructure. However, **business automation capabilities are limited** - marketing, sales, social media, and customer service functions are currently **stub implementations** that need full development.

**Current State:** üü° Partially Autonomous (Infrastructure Only)
**Goal State:** üü¢ Fully Autonomous Business Operations

---

## 1. CURRENT AUTONOMOUS CAPABILITIES

### ü§ñ The Brain: Autonomous Orchestrator (Claude C)

**Location:** `src/autonomous/orchestrator.ts`

**What It Does Daily:**
- **Every 5 minutes:** Analyzes all systems for optimization opportunities
- **Task Scheduling:** Prioritizes and queues autonomous tasks
- **Decision Making:** Evaluates risk/benefit of each task
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Routes tasks to specialized domain agents
- **Safety Governance:** Enforces clearance levels (READ_ONLY ‚Üí FULL_AUTONOMY)

**Configuration (from `.env`):**
```bash
AUTONOMOUS_ENABLED=true
AUTONOMOUS_CLEARANCE=SUGGEST                    # Current: Suggestion-only mode
AUTONOMOUS_ANALYSIS_INTERVAL=300000             # 5 minutes
AUTONOMOUS_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS=3               # Run 3 tasks in parallel
AUTONOMOUS_AUTO_APPROVE_SUGGESTIONS=true        # Auto-approve suggestions
AUTONOMOUS_AUTO_APPROVE_MODIFY_PRODUCTION=false # Requires approval for production changes
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Fully Operational**

---

### üè• Business Operator (Autonomous Service Management)

**Location:** `src/core/business-operator.ts`

- **Auto-restart** failed services (up to 3 attempts per 5-minute window)
- Send alerts to iPhone, macOS, Dashboard when services fail

**Every 5 Minutes:**
- Collect business metrics (uptime, performance, costs, users)
- Track AI API costs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Calculate error rates and response times
- Emit real-time metrics to dashboard

**Auto-Restart Example:**
```
Service vocalCoach is down
‚Üí Attempt 1: docker restart ai-dawg-vocal-coach
‚Üí Wait 30s, check health
‚Üí If still down: Attempt 2, Attempt 3
‚Üí After 3 failures: CRITICAL ALERT to iPhone + macOS

## 5. RISK & SAFETY GOVERNANCE

### Current Clearance Levels:

```typescript
enum ClearanceLevel {
  READ_ONLY = 0,         // Only observe, no modifications
  SUGGEST = 1,           // Make suggestions (CURRENT)
  MODIFY_SAFE = 2,       // Modify configs, tests, docs
  MODIFY_PRODUCTION = 3, // Modify production code
  FULL_AUTONOMY = 4,     // Full autonomous control
}
```

**Current Setting:** `SUGGEST` (Level 1)

**What This Means:**
- Jarvis can analyze everything
- Jarvis can make suggestions
- **Jarvis CANNOT auto-execute changes**
- All modifications require human approval

**To Enable Full Business Automation:**
```bash
# In .env file:
AUTONOMOUS_CLEARANCE=FULL_AUTONOMY
AUTONOMOUS_AUTO_APPROVE_MODIFY_PRODUCTION=true
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This gives Jarvis full control. Recommend starting with MODIFY_SAFE for business operations.

---

## CONCLUSION

**Current State:**
Jarvis autonomously manages AI DAWG infrastructure (health monitoring, cost optimization, code quality) but **does NOT** handle business operations (marketing, sales, customer service).

**Opportunity:**
By implementing 5-7 additional domain agents, Jarvis can **autonomously run your entire business** - from lead generation to customer support to ad campaign optimization.

**Timeline:** 10 weeks to full automation
**Cost:** ~$400/month
**ROI:** Save 160 hours/month, worth $6,400/month

**Next Step:** Confirm scope and I'll build the missing domains.

---

**Questions?**
- Want to see a specific domain implementation first?
- Need cost breakdown per domain?
- Want to start with just one area (e.g., social media only)?
