## ⚙️ Configuration

**Location**: `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/config/autonomy.json`

### Key Settings:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "ai_dawg": {
    "services": {
      "producer": {
        "port": 8001,
        "health_endpoint": "http://localhost:8001/health"
      },
      "vocal_coach": {
        "port": 8000,
        "health_endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/health"
      }
    }
  },
  "monitoring": {
    "health_check_interval_seconds": 30,
    "max_restart_attempts": 3,
    "restart_cooldown_seconds": 60
  },
  "safety": {
    "emergency_kill_switch": false,
    "max_consecutive_failures_before_escalation": 5
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Start Autonomous Management

```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts start
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Starts AI Producer (port 8001)
2. ✅ Starts Vocal Coach (port 8000)
3. ✅ Begins 30-second health checks
4. ✅ Auto-restarts failed services (max 3 attempts)
5. ✅ Logs all operations to audit trail

**Output**:
```
🚀 ========== AI DAWG Autonomous Manager Starting ==========
Config: /Users/benkennon/ai-dawg-v0.1
Services: 2
Health Check Interval: 30s
Max Restart Attempts: 3
===========================================================

🚀 Starting all services...

🚀 Starting AI Producer on port 8001...
✅ AI Producer started successfully (PID: 12345)

🚀 Starting Vocal Coach on port 8000...
✅ Vocal Coach started successfully (PID: 12346)

💓 Starting health monitoring (interval: 30s)
✅ Autonomous management started successfully
```

---

### Check Status

```bash
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts status
```

**Output**:
```
📊 ==================== Status Summary ====================
Total Services: 2
✅ Running: 2
🛑 Stopped: 0
⚠️  Unhealthy: 0
❓ Unknown: 0

📋 Service Details:
✅ AI Producer (port 8001): RUNNING Uptime: 5m 30s
✅ Vocal Coach (port 8000): RUNNING Uptime: 5m 28s
==========================================================
```

---

### Manual Restart

```bash
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts restart producer
```

---

### Manual Recovery

```bash
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts recover vocal_coach
```

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Service Controller**
- Starts services using configured commands
- Kills processes on specific ports if needed
- Redirects logs to designated log files
- Tracks PIDs and process state

### 2. **Health Monitor**
- Checks `/health` endpoint every 30 seconds
- Measures response time
- Detects timeouts, connection refused, etc.
- Triggers auto-recovery on failure

### 3. **Auto-Recovery**
- **Intelligent recovery** based on error type:
  - Port conflict → Kill conflicting process
  - Timeout → Give more time to start
  - Connection refused → Standard restart
- **Safety limits**:
  - Max 3 restart attempts
  - 60-second cooldown between restarts
  - Escalation after 5 consecutive failures

### 4. **Service Registry**
- Tracks service state (running, stopped, unhealthy)
- Records restart count and consecutive failures
- Persists state to disk
- Provides summary statistics

---

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### Emergency Kill Switch
Set in config: `"emergency_kill_switch": true` to disable all autonomous operations

### Max Restart Attempts
Default: 3 attempts before giving up and escalating

### Cooldown Period
Default: 60 seconds between restart attempts (prevents restart loops)

### Escalation
After 5 consecutive failures, logs to `escalations.log` and alerts human:

```
🚨 ========================== ESCALATION REQUIRED ==========================
Service: producer
Status: CRITICAL - Repeated failures detected
Consecutive Failures: 5
Restart Attempts: 3
Last Error: ECONNREFUSED
==========================================================================
```

### Audit Trail
All operations logged to `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/data/audit.log`:

```
2025-10-09T12:00:00.000Z | producer | start | SUCCESS | 2345ms
2025-10-09T12:05:00.000Z | producer | health_check | SUCCESS | 45ms
2025-10-09T12:10:00.000Z | vocal_coach | restart | SUCCESS | 3210ms
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Start Manager
```bash
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts start
```

**Expected**: Both services start, health monitoring begins

### Test 2: Kill a Service
```bash
# In another terminal
lsof -ti:8001 | xargs kill -9
```

**Expected**: Manager detects unhealthy service within 30s, auto-restarts it

### Test 3: Status Check
```bash
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts status
```

**Expected**: Shows current state of all services

### Test 4: Manual Restart
```bash
tsx src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts restart producer
```

**Expected**: Gracefully stops and restarts AI Producer

- ✅ Health checks run every 30 seconds
- ✅ Failed services auto-restart (max 3 attempts)
- ✅ Escalation after repeated failures

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
**Check**:
1. Are ports already in use? `lsof -i :8000 :8001`
2. Do Python venvs exist? `ls /Users/benkennon/ai-dawg-v0.1/src/ai/*/venv`
3. Check logs: `tail -f /Users/benkennon/ai-dawg-v0.1/logs/producer.log`

### Health checks failing
**Check**:
1. Is service actually running? `ps aux | grep python.*server.py`
2. Does health endpoint exist? `curl http://localhost:8001/health`
3. Check service logs for errors

### Auto-recovery not working
**Check**:
1. Has max restart count been reached? Check status output
2. Is service in cooldown? Wait 60 seconds
3. Check escalations.log for critical errors
