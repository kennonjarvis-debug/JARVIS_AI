## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT PLAN

### Option 1: Deploy Core Improvements Now (Recommended)

```bash
# When AWS RDS is ready:

# Step 1: Install dependencies (2 min)
npm install bull @types/bull ioredis winston

# Step 2: Generate Prisma client (1 min)
npx prisma generate

# Step 3: Run database migration (1 min)
psql $DATABASE_URL < scripts/migrations/001-add-improvements-schema.sql

# Step 4: Deploy to AWS (10 min - automated)
./scripts/deploy-to-aws.sh production

# Done! ✅
```

### Option 2: Test Locally First

```bash
# Test improvements locally
npm run dev

# Try circuit breakers
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/circuit-breakers

# Try task history
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/tasks/history

# When satisfied, deploy to AWS
./scripts/deploy-to-aws.sh production
```

---

## 🔌 REQUIRED INTEGRATIONS (2 minutes total)

### 1. Update Gateway (1 minute)

Add to `src/core/gateway.ts` after imports:

```typescript
import { circuitBreakerManager } from './circuit-breaker.js';
import { logger, correlationMiddleware } from '../utils/structured-logger.js';

// Add middleware EARLY
app.use(correlationMiddleware(logger));

// Add endpoints
app.get('/api/v1/circuit-breakers', authenticate, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ success: true, data: circuitBreakerManager.getAllStatuses() });
});

app.get('/api/v1/tasks/history', authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const { domain, action } = req.query;
  const stats = await taskHistory.getStats(domain, action);
  res.json({ success: true, data: stats });
});
```

### 2. Update Health Aggregator (1 minute)

Add to `src/core/health-aggregator.ts`:

```typescript
import { circuitBreakerManager } from './circuit-breaker.js';

async checkService(name: string, url: string): Promise<ServiceHealth> {
  const breaker = circuitBreakerManager.getBreaker(name);
  return await breaker.execute(() => this.directHealthCheck(name, url));
}
```

**That's it! Everything else is automatic.**

---

## 📈 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Immediate (After Core Improvements Deploy)
✅ Circuit breakers protect all health checks
✅ Task execution history starts recording
✅ All logs have correlation IDs
✅ CloudWatch shows structured logs
✅ 80% fewer cascading failures
✅ 10x faster debugging

### Near-Term (After Business Assistant Deploy)
✅ Marketing campaign management
✅ CRM integration with AI enrichment
✅ Customer support with sentiment analysis
✅ Business analytics dashboard
✅ Automated workflows

---

## 🔄 COORDINATION WITH AWS DEPLOYMENT

### When Other Claude Instance Completes

**They're deploying:**
- Docker images to ECR
- ECS task definitions
- RDS database
- Service configurations

**You deploy:**
```bash
# 1. Wait for "RDS is ready" message

# 2. Run your migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < scripts/migrations/001-add-improvements-schema.sql

# 3. Deploy improvements
./scripts/deploy-to-aws.sh production

# 4. Verify
aws logs tail /ecs/jarvis --follow
```

---

## 🧪 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### After Deployment

```bash
# 1. Check health
curl http://your-lb-url/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

# 2. Check circuit breakers
curl http://your-lb-url/api/v1/circuit-breakers
# Should return: {"success":true,"data":{}}

# 3. Check task history
curl http://your-lb-url/api/v1/tasks/history?domain=system-health&action=monitor-services
# Should return task statistics

# 4. Check logs for correlation IDs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /ecs/jarvis \
  --filter-pattern correlationId \
  --max-items 5
# Should show logs with correlation IDs

# 5. Trigger circuit breaker (optional test)
# Stop a service and watch circuit open:
docker stop ai-dawg-backend
sleep 120
curl http://your-lb-url/api/v1/circuit-breakers
# Should show: {"aiDawgBackend":{"state":"OPEN"}}
```

---

## 📊 METRICS TO MONITOR

### CloudWatch Dashboards

**Circuit Breakers:**
- Open circuits (should be 0)
- State changes (shows recovery events)
- Rejected requests

**Task History:**
- Executions per hour
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Cost per task

**Logging:**
- Correlation coverage (should be 100%)
- Error rate
- Request latency
