# Jarvis Proactive Adaptation Layer

## 🎯 Mission Complete

The proactive adaptation layer makes Jarvis **anticipate user needs before they ask**. This is THE MAGIC that makes Jarvis feel intelligent and proactive.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Context Monitor**
Tracks what the user is doing and detects work context:
- Debugging
- Metrics review
- Music production
- Deployment
- Feature development

### 2. **Adaptive Engine V2**
Learns from user interactions:
- Tracks clicks, dismissals, actions
- Builds user preference profiles
- Analyzes timing patterns
- Learns optimal notification times

### 3. **Timing Intelligence**
Prevents notification fatigue:
- Rate limiting (5/hour, 20/day by default)
- Minimum 15 minutes between notifications
- Do-not-disturb logic
- Critical notifications bypass limits

### 4. **Anticipation Engine** ⭐ THE MAGIC
Predicts what users need:

**Time-Based Patterns:**
- "It's 9am - you usually check metrics now"
- "3pm music production time - Vocal Coach ready"

**Context-Based Suggestions:**
- Debugging → "I found error patterns - want help?"
- Deployment → "Pre-deployment health check complete"
- Metrics → "Revenue dipped 12% - investigating"

**Event-Based Suggestions:**
- "3 deployment failures detected - I found the issue"
- "Critical system error - immediate attention needed"

### 5. **Notification Scheduler**
Manages notification delivery:
- Queues notifications
- Sends at optimal times
- Tracks sent notifications
- Emits events for UI display

### 6. **Proactive Agent**
Main orchestrator that connects everything:
- Starts the proactive system
- Routes events between components
- Handles user feedback
- Provides system status

## 🎨 UI Components

### Dashboard Integration

**Backend API Endpoints** (`dashboard/backend/dashboard-api.ts`):
```typescript
GET  /api/proactive/suggestions    - Get active suggestions
POST /api/proactive/feedback/:id   - Provide feedback
POST /api/proactive/user-action    - Track user interaction
```

**Frontend Components** (`dashboard/frontend/app/components/`):
- **NotificationBell.tsx** - Header bell icon with badge
- **ProactiveSuggestionCard.tsx** - Individual suggestion cards
- **ProactivePanel.tsx** - Side panel for viewing all suggestions
- **ToastNotification.tsx** - Toast notifications for real-time alerts

## 🚀 Usage

### Starting the Proactive Agent

```typescript
import { proactiveAgent } from './src/core/proactive';

// Start the proactive agent
await proactiveAgent.start();

// Track user interactions
await proactiveAgent.trackInteraction({
  id: 'interaction-123',
  actionType: 'click',
  target: 'dashboard-metrics',
  context: { page: 'dashboard' },
  timestamp: new Date()
});

// Provide feedback on suggestions
proactiveAgent.provideFeedback('suggestion-id', 'acted_upon');

// Get system status
const status = proactiveAgent.getStatus();
```

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
import NotificationBell from './components/NotificationBell';
import ProactivePanel from './components/ProactivePanel';

function Dashboard() {
  const [panelOpen, setPanelOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <NotificationBell onOpenSuggestions={() => setPanelOpen(true)} />
      <ProactivePanel isOpen={panelOpen} onClose={() => setPanelOpen(false)} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## 📊 Learning & Adaptation

The system continuously learns from user behavior:

1. **User clicks on a suggestion** → Positive signal → Increase confidence
2. **User dismisses suggestion** → Negative signal → Reduce frequency
3. **User ignores suggestion** → Neutral signal → No change
4. **Repeated patterns detected** → Create new suggestion types

### Confidence Scoring
All suggestions have confidence scores (0-1):
- **< 0.6**: Filtered out (below threshold)
- **0.6 - 0.8**: Medium confidence - shown as low/medium priority
- **0.8+**: High confidence - shown as high priority

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The proactive system tracks:
- **Response Rate**: % of suggestions acted upon
- **Average Response Time**: How fast users respond
- **Dismissal Rate**: % of suggestions dismissed
- **Rate Limit Adjustments**: Adapts based on feedback

## 🔮 Example Proactive Behaviors

✅ **Time-based:**
"It's 3pm - you usually work on music now. Vocal Coach is ready."

✅ **Context-based:**
"You're debugging - I analyzed recent errors and found a pattern. Want help?"

✅ **Event-based:**
"Deploy failed 3x - I found the common issue in logs. Here's the fix."

✅ **Opportunity:**
"Album launch in 2 days - marketing at 18%. Want to boost the campaign?"

✅ **Warning:**
"System performance dropped 20% - investigating cause now."

## 🛠️ Configuration

Default configuration in `proactive-agent.ts`:

```typescript
{
  enabled: true,
  maxNotificationsPerHour: 5,
  maxNotificationsPerDay: 20,
  minTimeBetweenNotifications: 15,  // minutes
  respectDoNotDisturb: true,
  learningEnabled: true,
  confidenceThreshold: 0.6
}
```
