## 🔮 Example Behaviors Implemented

### Time-Based Suggestions
```
"It's 9am - your usual time to check metrics. Here's today's summary."
```

### Context-Based Suggestions
```
Debugging Context: "I analyzed recent errors. Found a pattern - want help?"
Deployment Context: "Pre-deployment health check complete. All systems nominal."
Metrics Context: "Anomaly detected - Revenue dipped 12% today - investigating cause."
```

### Event-Based Suggestions
```
"3 failed deployments detected. I found the common issue."
"Critical system error - immediate attention needed."
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start the Dashboard API
```bash
cd /Users/benkennon/Jarvis/dashboard/backend
npm run dev
```

The proactive agent will automatically start and log:
```
✨ Proactive intelligence system is active
```

### Access Dashboard
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Use Proactive Features
1. **Click the bell icon** in the header to view suggestions
2. **Act on suggestions** to provide positive feedback
3. **Dismiss suggestions** to provide negative feedback
4. **System learns** from your behavior over time

## 🎓 Key Design Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern** - All services have single instances
2. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Components communicate via EventEmitter
3. **Confidence Scoring** - 0-1 scores filter low-quality predictions
4. **Feedback Loops** - System learns from user responses
5. **Rate Limiting** - Prevents notification fatigue
6. **Context Detection** - Multiple detection strategies

---

## 📈 Metrics Tracked

- Total notifications sent
- Response rate (% acted upon)
- Average response time
- Dismissal rate
- Current rate limit adjustments
- User preference strengths
- Timing pattern confidence

---

## 🔒 Configuration

Default settings (can be adjusted):
```typescript
{
  enabled: true,
  maxNotificationsPerHour: 5,
  maxNotificationsPerDay: 20,
  minTimeBetweenNotifications: 15,  // minutes
  respectDoNotDisturb: true,
  learningEnabled: true,
  confidenceThreshold: 0.6
}
```
