**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE & TESTED**
**Duration**: 2 hours

---

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

Jarvis can now **fully autonomously** run AI DAWG backend services with:
- ✅ **Zero human intervention** after initial start
- ✅ **Automatic service startup**
- ✅ **Continuous health monitoring** (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ **Intelligent auto-recovery** (max 3 attempts with cooldown)
- ✅ **Full audit trail** of all operations
- ✅ **Human escalation** after repeated failures

---

## 📦 What Was Delivered

### **1. Service Controller**
**File**: `src/ai-dawg-manager/service-controller.ts` (370 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- Start AI DAWG services via shell commands
- Stop services gracefully (or force-kill if needed)
- Restart with proper sequencing
- Kill conflicting processes on ports
- Log all operations to audit trail

**Key Methods**:
- `startService()` - Start a service and track PID
- `stopService()` - Gracefully stop or force-kill
- `restartService()` - Stop + Start with cooldown
- `executeCommand()` - Safe command execution with logging

---

### **2. Health Monitor**
**File**: `src/ai-dawg-manager/health-monitor.ts` (200 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- Checks `/health` endpoint every 30 seconds
- Measures response time
- Detects failures (timeout, connection refused, 5xx errors)
- Triggers callback on unhealthy services
- Provides health status summaries

**Key Methods**:
- `start()` - Begin periodic health checks
- `checkServiceHealth()` - Single health check
- `getHealthStatus()` - Get all service health
- `areAllServicesHealthy()` - Quick boolean check

---

### **3. Auto-Recovery Engine**
**File**: `src/ai-dawg-manager/auto-recovery.ts` (380 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- **Intelligent recovery** based on error type:
  - Port conflict → Kill conflicting process
  - Timeout → Give more time to start
  - Connection refused → Standard restart
- **Safety limits**:
  - Max 3 restart attempts
  - 60-second cooldown between attempts
  - Human escalation after 5 consecutive failures
- **Stable service rewards**: Reset counters after 2x cooldown period

**Key Methods**:
- `recoverService()` - Attempt recovery with limits
- `performIntelligentRecovery()` - Smart recovery based on error
- `escalateToHuman()` - Alert when manual intervention needed
- `resetCountersIfStable()` - Reward stable services

---

### **4. Service Registry**
**File**: `src/ai-dawg-manager/service-registry.ts` (220 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- Track service state (running, stopped, unhealthy, unknown)
- Record PIDs, uptime, restart counts, consecutive failures
- Persist state to disk (`data/service-state.json`)
- Provide summary statistics

**Key Methods**:
- `markRunning()` - Service started successfully
- `markUnhealthy()` - Health check failed
- `markHealthy()` - Health check passed
- `canRestart()` - Check if within max restart limit
- `needsEscalation()` - Check if human intervention needed

---

### **5. Main Manager**
**File**: `src/ai-dawg-manager/index.ts` (420 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- Orchestrate all components
- Start/stop autonomous management
- Periodic maintenance (every 5 minutes)
- Status reporting
- Manual service control

**Key Methods**:
- `start()` - Start autonomous management
- `stop()` - Stop management gracefully
- `getStatus()` - Get current system state
- `recoverService()` - Manual recovery trigger
- `restartService()` - Manual restart trigger

---

### **6. CLI Interface**
**File**: `src/ai-dawg-manager/cli.ts` (130 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- Command-line interface for all operations
- Start/stop autonomous management
- Check status
- Manual restart/recovery
- Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C

**Commands**:
```bash
npx tsx cli.ts start          # Start autonomous management
npx tsx cli.ts stop           # Stop management
npx tsx cli.ts status         # Show status
npx tsx cli.ts restart <svc>  # Restart service
npx tsx cli.ts recover <svc>  # Attempt recovery
```

---

### **7. Configuration**
**File**: `config/autonomy.json` (70 lines)

**Key Settings**:
- Service definitions (ports, health endpoints, start commands)
- Monitoring intervals (30s health checks)
- Safety limits (max 3 restarts, 60s cooldown)
- Escalation thresholds (5 consecutive failures)
- Notification settings (disabled by default)

**File**: `config/commands-whitelist.json` (30 lines)

**Security**:
- Whitelist of allowed commands
- Blocked dangerous commands (sudo, chmod 777)
- Approval-required operations (git push, npm install)

1. ✅ Start AI DAWG services
2. ✅ Monitor their health continuously
3. ✅ Auto-restart on failure (intelligently)
4. ✅ Escalate to human when needed
5. ✅ Log all operations for audit

**Total autonomous operation time**: **Indefinite** (runs until killed)
