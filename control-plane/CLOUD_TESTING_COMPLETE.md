## Test Adaptation Comparison

### Before (Local Autonomous Operations - Week 1)

**Focus**: Service runs on local machine

```typescript
describe('Autonomous Service Manager', () => {
  it('should auto-start services on boot', async () => {
    // Local service management
    await serviceManager.start('ai-dawg-backend');
    expect(await serviceManager.isRunning('ai-dawg-backend')).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

**Infrastructure**: Local SQLite, local file storage, manual scaling

### After (Cloud-First Infrastructure - Week 2+)

**Focus**: Services run on AWS/GCP with autonomous scaling

```typescript
describe('AWS ECS Deployment', () => {
  it('should deploy and auto-scale on high traffic', async () => {
    // Cloud deployment with auto-scaling
    await ecs.deployService({
      serviceName: 'jarvis-control-plane',
      desiredCount: 2
    });

    // Simulate high traffic
    await loadTest.generate({ requestsPerSecond: 1000 });

    // Verify auto-scaling
    const taskCount = await ecs.getRunningTasks();
    expect(taskCount).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(4); // Scaled from 2 to 4-5
  });
});
```

**Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL RDS, ElastiCache Redis, S3, multi-region, autonomous cost optimization
