**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Ready for autonomous validation

---

## What Was Done

Successfully adapted our real-world workflow tests to validate **Jarvis Autonomous System** (zero-touch operations for 7+ days).

### 1. Updated Instance 8 Test Orchestrator ✅

**File**: `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/.claude/prompts/instance-8-test-orchestrator.md`

**Changes**:
- Added **Autonomous Operations context section**
- Created **Agent 6: Autonomous Operations Tester**
- Updated Phase 2 to spawn **6 agents** instead of 5
- Updated Phase 3 monitoring to track autonomous tests
- Updated Phase 4 to aggregate 6 agent reports
- Added **autonomous operations validation section** to report template

**New Autonomous Context**:
```markdown
### JARVIS Autonomous Operations (Zero-Touch System)
- Control loop: Runs every 30 seconds, completes in <10s
- Auto-recovery: Max 3 retry attempts before human escalation
- Safety mechanisms: Kill switch, command whitelist, rollback
- Learning system: Pattern recognition, performance optimization
- Autonomous deployment: Git detection → staging → validation → production
- Target uptime: 7+ days without human intervention
```

### 2. Created Agent 6: Autonomous Operations Tester ✅

**New specialized agent** that tests:

#### Control Loop Validation
- Executes every 30s (±2s tolerance)
- Completes in <10s per iteration
- Runs for 24 hours (2,880 iterations)
- No skipped iterations

#### Auto-Recovery with Retry Limits

- After 3 failures → Human escalation
- Retry counter resets after success
- Cascading failure handling

#### Safety Mechanisms
- Emergency kill switch (JARVIS_AUTONOMOUS=false)
- Command whitelist enforcement
- Rollback on deployment failure
- Audit log immutability
- Rate limiting

#### Learning & Memory System
- SQLite event storage (1000+ events)

### 4. Created Test Directory Structure ✅

**Directory**: `/Users/benkennon/Jarvis/tests/autonomous/`

**Test Files to Generate** (Agent 6 will create these):
```

## Test Adaptation Comparison

### Before (Manual DevOps)

**Focus**: Human engineer responds to incidents

```typescript
describe('Incident Response', () => {
  it('should alert engineer within 60 seconds', async () => {
    // Human-in-the-loop workflow
    await serviceFailure();
    expect(await alertSent()).toBe(true);
    expect(await engineerNotified()).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

**Workflow**:
1. Service fails
2. Alert fires
3. Engineer notified
4. Engineer investigates (5-20 min)
5. Engineer fixes (20-60 min)

### After (Autonomous Operations)

**Focus**: System responds automatically, no human

```typescript
describe('Autonomous Auto-Recovery', () => {
  it('should auto-recover within 5 minutes without human', async () => {
    // Zero-touch workflow
    await serviceFailure();

    const result = await autoRecovery.execute();

    expect(result.recovered).toBe(true);
    expect(result.humanRequired).toBe(false);
    expect(result.timeToRecover).toBeLessThan(300000); // 5 min
  });
});
```

**Workflow**:
1. Service fails
2. Control loop detects (within 30s)
3. Auto-restart attempt 1
4. Auto-restart attempt 2 (if needed)
5. Auto-restart attempt 3 (if needed)
6. Human escalation (only if all 3 fail)

### 2. Review Agent 6 Results
After Instance 8 completes:
```bash
cat .claude/test-results/daily-report-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Look for **Agent 6: Autonomous Operations Tester** section.

### 3. Run Generated Tests
```bash
# Run all autonomous tests
npm test -- tests/autonomous/

# Check coverage
npm test -- --coverage tests/autonomous/
```

### 4. Fix Any Failures
Address bugs found by autonomous tests before 7-day deployment.

### 5. Deploy to Production
Once all tests pass:
- Set `JARVIS_AUTONOMOUS=true`
- Monitor for 7 days
- Review audit logs daily
- Check learning system insights weekly
