# Social Listening System - Cost Analysis & Rate Limit Strategy

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**System:** Jarvis Social Listening with Auto-Engage

## 🚨 CURRENT SITUATION

### Twitter API Free Tier Limitations

Based on live testing, your current Twitter API credentials show:

```
Rate Limit: 1 request per 15-minute window
Monthly Limit: 100 read requests total
Status: SEVERELY RESTRICTED
```

**This means:**
- You can make ~1 API call every 15 minutes
- Total of 100 searches per month
- System was hitting rate limit immediately (after 3-4 queries)

## 📝 NOTES

- Current setup uses Twitter FREE tier (100 requests/month)
- System optimized to 1 scan/day to stay within limits
- Claude API costs are negligible (~$0.003/response)
- Main cost driver is Twitter API tier
- **You likely exhausted today's quota during initial testing** (hit rate limit immediately)
- System will work again tomorrow when limits reset

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **Twitter FREE tier = 100 requests/month TOTAL** (not per day)
2. With 1 scan/day, you'll use ~30 requests/month ✅
3. Each additional scan costs 1 request (precious on free tier)
4. Quality > Quantity on free tier
5. Manual approval prevents wasting responses on bad opportunities
6. Track everything - data drives upgrade decisions
