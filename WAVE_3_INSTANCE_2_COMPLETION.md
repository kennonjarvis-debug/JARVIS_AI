## 🎓 Key Learnings & Decisions

### 1. Centralized Model Configuration

**Decision:** Use `DEFAULT_MODEL` from `src/integrations/anthropic.ts`

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth
- Easy to update model across all agents
- Prevents floating model ID issues
- Stable snapshot for production

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Centralized
import { DEFAULT_MODEL } from '../integrations/anthropic.js';
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({ model: DEFAULT_MODEL });

// ❌ Bad - Hardcoded
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4' });
```

### 2. Brevo Limit Enforcement

**Decision:** Enforce 300/day limit with automatic batching

**Rationale:**
- Free tier restriction
- Prevents API errors
- Maintains good sender reputation
- Automatic handling reduces manual work

**Implementation:**
- Check remaining daily count before sending
- Batch campaigns >300 recipients
- Schedule batches across days
- Reset count at midnight automatically

### 3. Abstract Base Class Design

**Decision:** BaseAgent is abstract with protected helpers

**Rationale:**
- DRY principle (don't repeat common logic)
- Consistent execution flow across agents
- Easy to extend for new agents
- Enforces standard patterns

**Benefits:**
- New agents inherit decision engine integration
- Approval workflow automatically included
- Memory storage consistent
- Error handling standardized

### 4. Test Strategy

**Decision:** Comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies

**Rationale:**
- Fast test execution
- Isolated component testing
- No external API calls needed
- Easy to test edge cases

**Coverage:**
- Happy paths
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases (limits, empty data)
- Integration points (mocked)

### 5. Daily Count Reset Logic

**Decision:** Automatic reset at midnight + manual override

**Rationale:**
- Automatic: Reduces manual intervention
- Manual: Allows testing and emergency resets
- Date comparison: Handles timezone correctly
- Triggered on every executeTask: Catches midnight boundary

## 🐛 Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Email Recipient Fetching**
   - Currently returns empty array for recipients
   - Needs integration with actual segment/contact management
   - TODO: Implement segment-to-recipients resolver

2. **Batch Execution**
   - Batches are planned but not automatically executed
   - Requires OperationsAgent to process scheduled batches
   - TODO: Build batch execution cron job (Instance 5)

3. **Social Media Profile IDs**
   - Requires manual configuration in .env
   - No automatic profile discovery
   - TODO: Implement Buffer profile discovery API

4. **Content Generation Prompts**
   - Basic prompts, could be more sophisticated
   - No prompt templates or variations
   - TODO: Build prompt library with A/B testing

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Batching**
   - Smart scheduling based on recipient time zones
   - Priority-based batch ordering
   - Batch resumption on failure

2. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track email open rates
   - Monitor social media engagement
   - A/B testing for content variations

3. **Multi-Language Support**
   - Content generation in multiple languages
   - Language-specific templates
   - Automatic translation

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel task execution
   - Caching for generated content
   - Batch similar tasks together
